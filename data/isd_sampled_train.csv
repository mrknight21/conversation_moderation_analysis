Phillips (role: for): Uh, and this is why earlier I said, we need to talk about people, because when we start talking in these broad terms, we’re talking about the black middle class, I happen to live in Los Angeles, down the street from Calabasas California, which is one of the wealthiest communities in America.
Joseph C. Phillips (role: for): THE idea that, that these children are in need of preferences because they don’t have access, uh ,to, to the same, uh, benefits that their white counterparts, is just ridiculous.

Robert Siegel (role: mod): John McWhorter?
John H. McWhorter (role: for): There’s a myth nowadays, there is a myth nowadays that that has been disproven.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): There are many studies, I’ve looked at all of them in detail, all of them show, even when they don’t think they're showing it, that there is a strong tendency for black kids to tease each other that way.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): But, the question is, how does, how do racial preference programs address that particular problem, which I think is addressable, and is being addressed by things that go on before kids go to college?
Tim Wise (role: against): Robert?
Tim Wise (role: against): I just, responding to the last thing John said, I think it’s interesting that he’s upset about, supposedly, ostensibly, middle class black kids saying that it’s white to be smart, and somehow that’s their pathology, and that’s the problem we should address.
Tim Wise (role: against): What I find interesting about it is that you, John, are affiliated with the Manhattan Institute, which has received money from the Bradley Foundation, hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Tim Wise (role: against): So, when you say that black folks say being smart or doing well in school is acting white, the book, The Bell Curve, funded by the same people that fund the organization you work for, basically says the same thing, it says high IQ is white, or perhaps Asian, and black folks are genetically defective.
Tim Wise (role: against): And not one prominent conservative in this country, including the three of you, said anything public when The Bell Curve came out, not one word, not one prominent conservative.","{'breakdown': None, 'post': {'undecided': 6.0, 'for': 40.0, 'against': 55.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 22.0, 'for': 34.0, 'against': 44.0}}",Robert Siegel,mod,John McWhorter?

Tim Wise (role: against): I’m pretty willing to stand on that this evening.
Tim Wise (role: against): Sure thing, um, John, you suggest that, people of color are potentially less qualified as evidenced by their college performance, maybe should go less selective schools as a result.
Tim Wise (role: against): Does that mean that men are unqualified for the slots that they receive in colleges and law schools, and that maybe they should lower their sights to second- and third-tier schools and leave the best slots and opportunities for all the women.
Robert Siegel (role: mod): John McWhorter, your answer.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): I mean we’ve long known about those particular gender discrepancies, and if we’re gonna talk about a kind of mindless bean-counting, then no, I’m not in favor of that kind of address of racial preferences, but when you’re dealing with schools which before a ban on preferences have a stark, two-tiered system, where black students are crashing and burning at much faster rates, then I think that in terms of arguing about—
John H. McWhorter (role: for): —morality, and how we address the past, and how we help people cope, with a nation where I don’t think that the playing field could ever possibly be perfectly level, that, there is an issue for talking about racial preferences rather than what you’re talking about.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): Khin, I would just ask you this.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): A very smart young woman during the ban on racial preferences told me that she—she was an undergraduate working in the recruiting office—was discouraging black applicants from coming to UC Berkeley if they made really high SAT scores and had really good grades.

John H. McWhorter (role: for): A very smart young woman during the ban on racial preferences told me that she—she was an undergraduate working in the recruiting office—was discouraging black applicants from coming to UC Berkeley if they made really high SAT scores and had really good grades.

Crenshaw (role: against): What do we have to know about the lives of African-American middle class to come to the conclusion that perhaps one generation ago they were socio-economically disadvantaged, but this generation they're not?
Kimberlé W. Crenshaw (role: against): Now, is it going to be the same level of Affirmative Action as someone who is, um, truly, uh, impoverished?
Kimberlé W. Crenshaw (role: against): But most Affirmative Action programs don’t function that way.

Joseph C. Phillips (role: for): That's what we’re saying here.
Robert Siegel (role: mod): Briefly from John McWhorter, and then a reply, perhaps, from the, uh… …the opponents.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): I think that one thing that we are leaving out of the discussion, and you have to bring it in, is that much of the reason that, uh, middle class black kids have trouble with submitting the same kind of file as a white kid would have, is a tendency among black teens to say that it is white to do well in school.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): And I’d like to try to be as pacific as possible here, pacific is the word I'm using, but here I can't, that’s a myth.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): There are reasons for it.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): We can't just leave that out of the discussion because the data is inconvenient, and I think it’s absolutely crucial to the things that we’re talking about.
Robert Siegel (role: mod): That’s John McWhorter, and we’ve heard several points made by the supporters of the motion, so to the opponents, and Tim Wise, yes?
Tim Wise (role: against): It’s an issue, we could discuss it at a different time.
Tim Wise (role: against): This is a foundation that paid Charles Murray to write The Bell Curve, which is a book that doesn’t imply that black people are inferior, it screams it from forty percent of its pages.
Tim Wise (role: against): I find it disingenuous for you to put the burden of that on black children, and not the very wealthy, well- heeled, well-funded white folks who actually print material that says black people are defective.
Tim Wise (role: against): Let’s place our attention on those who actually say that white people are smarter, and black people are inferior, and you won't hear that from any of this.
Robert Siegel (role: mod): John McWhorter, quick reply, then we’ll get another question.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): Sir, when The Bell Curve came out, I was very young, I had no public presence, I was studying linguistics, and so I don’t know what I would have said.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): Charles Murray has nothing to do with the Manhattan Institute, and stopped, as a matter of fact, while he was writing that book.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): But what’s important is that when I talk about the “acting white” phenomenon, I'm not saying that it’s a pathology, I'm not blaming the black kids for this, this is something that happened as the result of a sequence of socio-historical things that ultimately have their root in racism.","{'breakdown': None, 'post': {'undecided': 6.0, 'for': 40.0, 'against': 55.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 22.0, 'for': 34.0, 'against': 44.0}}",John H.

Robert Siegel (role: mod): Or not quite that important—
Joseph C. Phillips (role: for): I was going to say, I'm glad you put that up, because I'm not convinced that diversity is all that important, uh, diversity in terms of skin color.
Joseph C. Phillips (role: for): When you talk to college students, and people have been to college, and what was most important about their college experience, it had to do not with the color of the person sitting next to them, but the values of, of the teachers, and those kinds of things.
Joseph C. Phillips (role: for): Uh, I'm for that.
Joseph C. Phillips (role: for): Um, am I, am I for people manipulating and forcing people?
Joseph C.

Joseph C. Phillips (role: for): That is not, in my opinion, a bad thing.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): Robert, can I interject something quickly—
John H. McWhorter (role: for): Just real quick.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): I think we have to be very careful with the words integration and segregation, as they happen to have drifted into certain implications in our time.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): And so we talk about schools, and for me, a dominant image is, for example, Kip Academies, where all the kids are black or brown and poor, and they're being taught very well by dedicated teachers, and there are new Kip Academies every year.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): That excites me.
Robert Siegel (role: mod): I agreed to, I agreed to a brief statement—
Robert Siegel (role: mod): And one rebuttal, if you want to make it, form the side opposing the resolution.

Kimberlé W. Crenshaw (role: against): It’s not just about racial preferences, whatever you define that to be.
Kimberlé W. Crenshaw (role: against): And this other side is happy to have societies, to have institutions that are racially separated, to have communities that do not interact with each other, and have all white institutions, all black institutions, and all Asians.

Joseph C. Phillips (role: for): Uh, and this is why earlier I said, we need to talk about people, because when we start talking in these broad terms, we’re talking about the black middle class, I happen to live in Los Angeles, down the street from Calabasas California, which is one of the wealthiest communities in America.
Joseph C. Phillips (role: for): THE idea that, that these children are in need of preferences because they don’t have access, uh ,to, to the same, uh, benefits that their white counterparts, is just ridiculous.

Robert Siegel (role: mod): John McWhorter?
John H. McWhorter (role: for): There’s a myth nowadays, there is a myth nowadays that that has been disproven.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): There are many studies, I’ve looked at all of them in detail, all of them show, even when they don’t think they're showing it, that there is a strong tendency for black kids to tease each other that way.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): But, the question is, how does, how do racial preference programs address that particular problem, which I think is addressable, and is being addressed by things that go on before kids go to college?
Tim Wise (role: against): Robert?
Tim Wise (role: against): I just, responding to the last thing John said, I think it’s interesting that he’s upset about, supposedly, ostensibly, middle class black kids saying that it’s white to be smart, and somehow that’s their pathology, and that’s the problem we should address.
Tim Wise (role: against): What I find interesting about it is that you, John, are affiliated with the Manhattan Institute, which has received money from the Bradley Foundation, hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Tim Wise (role: against): So, when you say that black folks say being smart or doing well in school is acting white, the book, The Bell Curve, funded by the same people that fund the organization you work for, basically says the same thing, it says high IQ is white, or perhaps Asian, and black folks are genetically defective.

Robert Siegel (role: mod): —in 60 seconds—
Joseph C. Phillips (role: for): I’d like to know, uh, I, I listened to Tim’s speech, and, um…I, I, I… I thought, um…and wanted to know why is it that, uh, that blacks, or that you seem to think that blacks can only achieve, when the playing field is level.
Tim Wise (role: against): I happen to think people of—you know, Madame C.J.
Tim Wise (role: against): could make it, you know, all y’all could’ve made it.
Tim Wise (role: against): But no one in their right mind would’ve said, see, everybody should go out there and work so I think folks can succeed, the question is what are our obligations as a society to create a level playing field, has nothing to do with what the outcome can or cannot be.
Tim Wise (role: against): I’m pretty willing to stand on that this evening.
Tim Wise (role: against): Sure thing, um, John, you suggest that, people of color are potentially less qualified as evidenced by their college performance, maybe should go less selective schools as a result.
Tim Wise (role: against): Does that mean that men are unqualified for the slots that they receive in colleges and law schools, and that maybe they should lower their sights to second- and third-tier schools and leave the best slots and opportunities for all the women.
Robert Siegel (role: mod): John McWhorter, your answer.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): I mean we’ve long known about those particular gender discrepancies, and if we’re gonna talk about a kind of mindless bean-counting, then no, I’m not in favor of that kind of address of racial preferences, but when you’re dealing with schools which before a ban on preferences have a stark, two-tiered system, where black students are crashing and burning at much faster rates, then I think that in terms of arguing about—
John H. McWhorter (role: for): —morality, and how we address the past, and how we help people cope, with a nation where I don’t think that the playing field could ever possibly be perfectly level, that, there is an issue for talking about racial preferences rather than what you’re talking about.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): Khin, I would just ask you this.
John H. McWhorter (role: for): A very smart young woman during the ban on racial preferences told me that she—she was an undergraduate working in the recruiting office—was discouraging black applicants from coming to UC Berkeley if they made really high SAT scores and had really good grades.

Kimberlé W.

Kimberlé W. Crenshaw (role: against): Because that is decidedly not what he says.
Joseph C. Phillips (role: for): It’s my position, that, uh…affirmative action, in the form of racial non-discrimination, is a good thing, it’s good for America, that’s what Colin Powell says.

Kimberlé W. Crenshaw (role: against): —let me point this out.

John Donvan (role: mod): They have made the argument that the new technology-- and we all know what we're talking about because it's in our pockets-- is creating a new environment of constant distraction and perpetual interruption which leads to a kind of cognitive overload, which ultimately diminishes attentiveness, and as a result, accumulation and use of knowledge suffers.
John Donvan (role: mod): They also make the case that smart technology creates a false ideal of intimacy which in itself is actually devoid of communication, and in that sense, harmful to the culture overall.
John Donvan (role: mod): Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb The team arguing against the motion, Genevieve Bell and David Weinberger, argue that thanks to smart technology, we are living in a renaissance of knowledge, that being smart means being able to understand the world better, to be better at our work than ever before.
John Donvan (role: mod): They hail the fact that the gatekeepers of knowledge are on the run and possibly in some cases dead.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they talked about, in general, the expansion of cultural knowledge, particularly in communities who previously didn't have ways to connect or had a voice, and that the technology gives them those voices.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I hear-- we've had many, many layers of this argument already brought out, both in terms of putting this in a hardware/software term, but we've also looked at the impact of the technology both on the individual and then on the culture.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I think we need to take some of those in turn.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to start more with the argument that was made about the impacts on the individual and his ability to gather and use knowledge.
John Donvan (role: mod): And it sounds to me-- I want to take this to David Weinberger.
John Donvan (role: mod): You have celebrated the vast expansion of the amount of information out there.
John Donvan (role: mod): But I-- it seems to me that your opponents are saying that information is not knowledge, and that there's an important distinction.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to see if you take that point or would refute it:
David Weinberger (role: against): Well, on the one hand, I am not happy with the metaphorical use-- and yes, I am goading you, I think, Nick-- the metaphorical use of information, knowledge, and wisdom.
David Weinberger (role: against): This is a pyramid that was constructed that was-- somebody came up with, Russell Ackoff, I think, in the 1990s.
David Weinberger (role: against): And it's become canon that I think that it is not-- it's a nice metaphor, but it's actually a wrong metaphor.
David Weinberger (role: against): The idea is, it's a pyramid, right?
David Weinberger (role: against): Many of you have seen this.
David Weinberger (role: against): Businesses put up, like every hour that diagram is drawn on some business law somewhere.
David Weinberger (role: against): Data information knowledge, wisdom.
David Weinberger (role: against): It's a pyramid because the idea is that knowledge is a matter-- we think knowledge is a matter of filtering out information.
David Weinberger (role: against): So we start with broad-based data.
David Weinberger (role: against): That gets filtered out.
David Weinberger (role: against): What's worthy information is-- in data becomes information and so on up the path.
David Weinberger (role: against): And certainly wisdom does not work that way.
David Weinberger (role: against): Wisdom doesn't make sense in that if you think about it for a moment.
David Weinberger (role: against): And I also don't think knowledge works that way either.
David Weinberger (role: against): Knowledge is not a filtering of information.
David Weinberger (role: against): In fact, let me-- the information itself is very suspect.
John Donvan (role: mod): --take it to your opponent that he actually refutes-- he refutes the assertion that knowledge and information are different, which is-- on which your argument hinges.
John Donvan (role: mod): But just having a bunch of stuff is not such a great advantage.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb I fundamentally disagree that the concepts of information, knowledge and wisdom are mere metaphors that were invented in the 1990s.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): That's insane.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): This is-- but this is fundamental to our understanding of what it means to be a thoughtful, you know, intelligent person, is the ability to gather lots of information, to be aware of things going on.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): But then the crucial part is stepping back from the flow, taking that information and creating personal knowledge in your own mind.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): So there is a fundamental distinction between grabbing stuff online, between checking your Twitter feed or your Facebook notifications, and actually raising that up through connections, through contacts, through cultural knowledge.
John Donvan (role: mod): You do not dispute your opponent's, Nick, that there is, at minimum, a whole lot more information available to individuals than there used to be.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): Absolutely, there's a whole lot more information.
John Donvan (role: mod): The question is whether it's meaningful.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): The question is, how do we think?
John Donvan (role: mod): David Weinberger.
David Weinberger (role: against): Again, so it would be insane to say that we invented knowledge in the 1990s, somewhere The diagram in which we think that this is how the filtration process works I think is fundamentally misleading, that knowledge is not a filtering of information.
David Weinberger (role: against): It's a social process-- sorry, the epistemological chaos that-- it is somewhat chaotic.
David Weinberger (role: against): It's a social process in which we engage with one another.

David Weinberger (role: against): Again, so it would be insane to say that we invented knowledge in the 1990s, somewhere The diagram in which we think that this is how the filtration process works I think is fundamentally misleading, that knowledge is not a filtering of information.
David Weinberger (role: against): It's a social process-- sorry, the epistemological chaos that-- it is somewhat chaotic.
David Weinberger (role: against): It's a social process in which we engage with one another.
David Weinberger (role: against): We-- knowledge is based in large part upon social-- relationships and makes social relationships.
David Weinberger (role: against): The computer based model of the brain that you and most of our culture accepts I think is highly suspect.
David Weinberger (role: against): And if we look past going-- you know, scanning down your Facebook feed to see what's new and think about the times in which we actually do form knowledge, this new ecosystem, which I totally agree with you, we now have, is in fact spectacularly good for the formation of knowledge.

David Weinberger<against>: Senior Researcher, Berkman Center & Author, Too Big to Know","David Weinberger (role: against): In fact, let me-- the information itself is very suspect.
David Weinberger (role: against): Knowledge is not a filtering of information.
David Weinberger (role: against): And I also don't think knowledge works that way either.
David Weinberger (role: against): Wisdom doesn't make sense in that if you think about it for a moment.
David Weinberger (role: against): And certainly wisdom does not work that way.
David Weinberger (role: against): What's worthy information is-- in data becomes information and so on up the path.
David Weinberger (role: against): That gets filtered out.
David Weinberger (role: against): So we start with broad-based data.
David Weinberger (role: against): It's a pyramid because the idea is that knowledge is a matter-- we think knowledge is a matter of filtering out information.
David Weinberger (role: against): Data information knowledge, wisdom.
David Weinberger (role: against): Businesses put up, like every hour that diagram is drawn on some business law somewhere.
David Weinberger (role: against): Many of you have seen this.
David Weinberger (role: against): The idea is, it's a pyramid, right?
David Weinberger (role: against): And it's become canon that I think that it is not-- it's a nice metaphor, but it's actually a wrong metaphor.
David Weinberger (role: against): This is a pyramid that was constructed that was-- somebody came up with, Russell Ackoff, I think, in the 1990s.
David Weinberger (role: against): Well, on the one hand, I am not happy with the metaphorical use-- and yes, I am goading you, I think, Nick-- the metaphorical use of information, knowledge, and wisdom.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to see if you take that point or would refute it:
John Donvan (role: mod): But I-- it seems to me that your opponents are saying that information is not knowledge, and that there's an important distinction.
John Donvan (role: mod): You have celebrated the vast expansion of the amount of information out there.
John Donvan (role: mod): And it sounds to me-- I want to take this to David Weinberger.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to start more with the argument that was made about the impacts on the individual and his ability to gather and use knowledge.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I think we need to take some of those in turn.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I hear-- we've had many, many layers of this argument already brought out, both in terms of putting this in a hardware/software term, but we've also looked at the impact of the technology both on the individual and then on the culture.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they talked about, in general, the expansion of cultural knowledge, particularly in communities who previously didn't have ways to connect or had a voice, and that the technology gives them those voices.
John Donvan (role: mod): They hail the fact that the gatekeepers of knowledge are on the run and possibly in some cases dead.
John Donvan (role: mod): Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb The team arguing against the motion, Genevieve Bell and David Weinberger, argue that thanks to smart technology, we are living in a renaissance of knowledge, that being smart means being able to understand the world better, to be better at our work than ever before.
John Donvan (role: mod): They also make the case that smart technology creates a false ideal of intimacy which in itself is actually devoid of communication, and in that sense, harmful to the culture overall.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have made the argument that the new technology-- and we all know what we're talking about because it's in our pockets-- is creating a new environment of constant distraction and perpetual interruption which leads to a kind of cognitive overload, which ultimately diminishes attentiveness, and as a result, accumulation and use of knowledge suffers.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two debaters argue strenuously for the motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): The motion is this: Smart technology is making us dumb.
John Donvan (role: mod): And round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you and our live audience here in New York.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now we move on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that is our motion: Smart technology is making us dumb.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Genevieve Bell.
Andrew Keen (role: for): Well, I don't even like this word, ""information.""
John Donvan (role: mod): I'm sorry.
John Donvan (role: mod): It's Keen.
John Donvan (role: mod): Yeah, because I've got the team of Keen and Carr.
John Donvan (role: mod): Yeah.
Andrew Keen (role: for): Yeah, I'm always known as Andrew Carr on Wikipedia.
Andrew Keen (role: for): And I tend to think that we even have to distinguish data from information.
Andrew Keen (role: for): But this overpowering nature of data is troubling in all sorts of ways.
Andrew Keen (role: for): Smart Technology is Making Us DumbSo there is a double vulgarity here, and I would much rather talk about a big data economy than an information economy.
John Donvan (role: mod): And your opponent just said that-- that we are drowning in data, which would appear to try to set on its heels your argument that the plethora of stuff that we now have is in itself a good thing, because it's too much.
Genevieve Bell (role: against): I mean, you know, let's think about Snowden and Chelsea Manning.
Genevieve Bell (role: against): I mean, you know, whether we can argue about the legality of those, but the data that they generated revealed things about the contours of the world writ large and the world writ small, and made clear all manner of things that we might want as citizens, as human beings, as women to argue about.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): But the data they generated was data about the incredible surveillance apparatus that is built around smart technology deployed by the government.

Nicholas Carr (role: for): And, in fact, you-- if you look at the research, the researchers talk about the F pattern by which they mean that people-- when they-- when people read on a computer screen, they go across the first couple of lines of text all the way, and then their eyes drift down the margin a little bit.

Nicholas Carr (role: for): On way of reading is skimming.

Nicholas Carr (role: for): And, in fact, you-- if you look at the research, the researchers talk about the F pattern by which they mean that people-- when they-- when people read on a computer screen, they go across the first couple of lines of text all the way, and then their eyes drift down the margin a little bit.

Nicholas Carr (role: for): Better and more important is actually reading deeply, whether it's fiction or nonfiction or anything.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): That's when you learn stuff, and that's the kind of reading that we're losing, thanks to our smart technologies.

Nicholas Carr (role: for): The question is, on balance, is this making us dumber or smarter?
Nicholas Carr (role: for): There's a great study that came out of Stanford, where the researchers got two groups of people.

John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): And we want to come to that part of the discussion shortly.
John Donvan (role: mod): Do you-- first of all, do you dispute it or concede it?
Genevieve Bell (role: against): I'm not sure I'm willing to dispute it, but I'm willing to suggest that, you know, we're at a very-- it may not feel like it to many of us in this room-- Nick obviously the exception, having only had a smartphone for six months.
Genevieve Bell (role: against): It doesn't always feel that way, but a lot of this technology has been in mainstream adoption in the United States for less than a decade.
Genevieve Bell (role: against): And then I think the second question is, I am also interested in what those studies look like beyond the United States, and about what it means to not keep reducing smart technology down to Facebook, Google, Twitter, and a phone, when in fact, we know that the technologies that are in people's worlds that are smart are far beyond that.

John Donvan (role: mod): Do you want to respond to that point?
Andrew Keen (role: for): Yeah.
Andrew Keen (role: for): I'm very suspicious of Genevieve's sort of argument about the non-Western world.
Andrew Keen (role: for): We always hear, ""Well, this is going to change everything.
Andrew Keen (role: for): This is going to solve poverty.
Andrew Keen (role: for): But look at the Arab Spring.
Andrew Keen (role: for): It was supposedly doing away with the totalitarianism in the Middle East.
Andrew Keen (role: for): And what we see with this technology is its failure to actually create coherent political movements because of the death of distance, because of this intimacy and personalization.
Andrew Keen (role: for): It's like a firework.
Andrew Keen (role: for): And when you look up in the sky, it's wonderful for about 10 seconds.
Andrew Keen (role: for): There's no consequence.
Andrew Keen (role: for): The very depth that Nick talks about in epistemological terms is also missing in social and political terms.

Andrew Keen (role: for): Well, you did talk about aboriginals.

Andrew Keen (role: for): And in that sense, you know, David's arguments about the web I think were flatware So I do think we have to be careful because, after all, everything is technology.
Andrew Keen (role: for): The-- a water pipe is technology, a bathroom is technology.

John Donvan (role: mod): David Weinberger, I--
Genevieve Bell (role: against): David?
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponents mentioned Arab Spring as being something of a catastrophe of smart technology, by which I think what they're really saying is that at the time, back in 2011, that it was hailed as a-- as a moment of triumph for Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb smart technology bringing together people forcing political action, ultimately leading to their liberation and freedom, or at least the impulse in that direction.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to sort of get your reaction to that.

David Weinberger (role: against): But-- or smart.
David Weinberger (role: against): Okay.
David Weinberger (role: against): Andrew.
David Weinberger (role: against): I don't know who makes promises and so forth.
David Weinberger (role: against): This was a leaderless organization.
David Weinberger (role: against): They should have a voice.
David Weinberger (role: against): Why can't they do it in public for their government?
David Weinberger (role: against): And so they use the internet in a complex environment.

Nicholas Carr (role: for): And you can communicate good stuff, and you can communicate bad stuff.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): You can-- you can organize antigovernment protests or you can be the government using the technology to track those protesters and throwing-- throw them in jail.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): I think it can do both things, as all communication platforms do.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): And there, I think the picture is much darker.
David Weinberger (role: against): So, yes, internet is just a communication platform, but it's not just a communication platform.
David Weinberger (role: against): And so if you're on the internet, you are very likely going to learn some things beyond that you can communicate.
David Weinberger (role: against): You can speak.

David Weinberger (role: against): So-- I do think there's some disagreement on the panel about what we're talking about in terms of culture.
David Weinberger (role: against): So-- I’m not sure what promise was made.
David Weinberger (role: against): But the internet proved itself not only to be a superb tool for organizing, for organizing people without a leader, which is a pretty remarkable thing.
David Weinberger (role: against): It also, I noticed, from talking with people from Tunisia, they credit, at least in part, the internet with giving them the idea of freedom, the sense that they can have a voice.
David Weinberger (role: against): They are-- it is their right as citizens because they can do it on the net.
David Weinberger (role: against): And I will use the word; that is empowering.

John Donvan (role: mod): Nick Carr.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): I think the internet is a communication platform.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): You can communicate healthcare information, as Genevieve said, or you can be ISIS and send out YouTube videos of beheadings as a recruitment tool.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): So I don't think you can-- I don't think you can leap to the assumption that even as a basic communication platform this is something that is naturally or inclined to be a good thing that raises people up and lets them think deeper thoughts.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): And I think we really have to-- have to look at what-- how the technology influences what we do with the communications, how it influences our relationship to our thinking and to one another.
John Donvan (role: mod): David Weinberger.
David Weinberger (role: against): It has particular, as they say, affordances, things that it's good at.

Andrew Keen (role: for): You said the internet allows people to talk as if somehow in the pre-internet age, before computers, people couldn't talk.
Andrew Keen (role: for): The digital platform certainly does enable us to talk.
Andrew Keen (role: for): But the reality, of course-- and McLuhan came out with this in his ironically termed ""Global Village,"" is the ironic nature of the internet is it's not global.
Andrew Keen (role: for): But the reality is study after study has shown-- as shown in an excellent book called ""The Filter Bubble,"" the reality is that we're talking to fewer and fewer people.
Andrew Keen (role: for): But if anything, we're talking less now than we were before the invention of the internet.

Genevieve Bell (role: against): You’ll concede to the notion that a well- formed question is an appropriate way to engage with a piece of technology.
Genevieve Bell (role: against): I mean, I think it's coming back to this for me, right, is how are you framing ""dumb"" and it's opposition and what that means, right.
Genevieve Bell (role: against): Those are questions that technology may be able to save you quicker than calling your own parent because she's in a different country.
Genevieve Bell (role: against): I don't think so.
John Donvan (role: mod): Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb David, hold up one second.
John Donvan (role: mod): Nick.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): There's an interesting interview just recently with a top search engineer at Google.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): And the interviewer said, ""So I assume that as the-- as Google search engine has gotten smarter, people's questions have also gotten smarter.” And he said-- he laughed and said, ""No, it's exactly the opposite.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): And as a result, we get lazy, we fall victim to what scientists call automation complacency.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): So even the formation of questions, we seem to be getting worse and worse as the searching gets better and better.
David Weinberger (role: against): So-- As I understand it, Nick, what's actually going on with the searches is that they've gotten much longer.
David Weinberger (role: against): Whereas before, the well-- forming a question well with Google meant figuring out what were the terms that Google wanted that would give you back the right results.
David Weinberger (role: against): But I think that your comments about people Googling and they think that they're smart is that you're actually, I think, repeating Socrates' mistake which is, you know, really good company to be in.
David Weinberger (role: against): He's wondering about the smart tech of his time, which was writing things down.
David Weinberger (role: against): And he said, ""This is terrible because our memory will fail.
David Weinberger (role: against): But generally, our memory has gotten much smaller than it - - than it was.
David Weinberger (role: against): The Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb effect of literacy has in fact made our memory a thousand times better.
John Donvan (role: mod): Andrew Keen.
Andrew Keen (role: for): I think just to speak-- no, but you're the one who brought up Socrates, right?
David Weinberger (role: against): I was making a point, though, so--
Andrew Keen (role: for): So what was-- Socrates is great, his contribution.
Andrew Keen (role: for): And what they're really lazy about is asking questions.
Andrew Keen (role: for): And that is one of the consequences or casualties of this digital revolution.
Andrew Keen (role: for): That was the whole point of his philosophy, was it was about asking questions.
Andrew Keen (role: for): And as Nick has made it clear, we have forgotten, or we are forgetting how to ask questions, and that's extremely troubling.
David Weinberger (role: against): So the other criticism-- the other criticism or fear that Socrates had in that dialogue about writing was that written stuff is never as good as in person, face to face, because the written thing will not respond to you.
David Weinberger (role: against): And the internet is not a series of answers.
David Weinberger (role: against): And now we are able to engage in conversations about any topic, whether it's about epistemological chaos, or it's about whether Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb a Mini Cooper is any good in the winter in Boston.

Nicholas Carr (role: for): And then you click, and you go somewhere else.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): Better and more important is actually reading deeply, whether it's fiction or nonfiction or anything.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): That's when you learn stuff, and that's the kind of reading that we're losing, thanks to our smart technologies.

Nicholas Carr (role: for): And, fortunately, we used to be-- you know, used to get involved in ""War and Peace.” And now we get involved in ""Game of Thrones.” And that's all fine.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): The question is, on balance, is this making us dumber or smarter?
Nicholas Carr (role: for): There's a great study that came out of Stanford, where the researchers got two groups of people.

John Donvan (role: mod): David, I want to-- I want to bring this back to a high level, high plane.
John Donvan (role: mod): And now it doesn't look so good.
John Donvan (role: mod): Does Arab Spring represent the failure of the promise, or does the Arab Spring reveal the false promise of smart technology?
David Weinberger (role: against): I'm also not entirely sure what this has to do with being dumb.
John Donvan (role: mod): Well, I think it does in a sense that we're making broader claims about the-- about whether cultures are getting-- are being raised up.
David Weinberger (role: against): So-- I do think there's some disagreement on the panel about what we're talking about in terms of culture.
David Weinberger (role: against): So-- I’m not sure what promise was made.
David Weinberger (role: against): But the internet proved itself not only to be a superb tool for organizing, for organizing people without a leader, which is a pretty remarkable thing.
David Weinberger (role: against): It also, I noticed, from talking with people from Tunisia, they credit, at least in part, the internet with giving them the idea of freedom, the sense that they can have a voice.
David Weinberger (role: against): They are-- it is their right as citizens because they can do it on the net.
David Weinberger (role: against): And I will use the word; that is empowering.

Andrew Keen (role: for): I think that what we have in our age of the smart machine, of smart technology is an avalanche of data.
Andrew Keen (role: for): And I certainly-- you know, I bow down to Nick in this area from a scientific and an epistemological point of view.
Andrew Keen (role: for): And perhaps most troubling of all-- Nick pointed to this-- was while we're all drowning in data, most of it extremely irrelevant at best-- inane, vulgar-- a tiny handful of Silicon Valley companies, most notably Google and Facebook, are making fortunes out of that data, not because it's correct, not because it has any value to civilization, not because it's solving problems in Africa, but because they're selling advertising around it.

Nicholas Carr (role: for): Absolutely, there's a whole lot more information.
John Donvan (role: mod): You do not dispute your opponent's, Nick, that there is, at minimum, a whole lot more information available to individuals than there used to be.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): So there is a fundamental distinction between grabbing stuff online, between checking your Twitter feed or your Facebook notifications, and actually raising that up through connections, through contacts, through cultural knowledge.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): But then the crucial part is stepping back from the flow, taking that information and creating personal knowledge in your own mind.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): This is-- but this is fundamental to our understanding of what it means to be a thoughtful, you know, intelligent person, is the ability to gather lots of information, to be aware of things going on.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): That's insane.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb I fundamentally disagree that the concepts of information, knowledge and wisdom are mere metaphors that were invented in the 1990s.
John Donvan (role: mod): But just having a bunch of stuff is not such a great advantage.
John Donvan (role: mod): --take it to your opponent that he actually refutes-- he refutes the assertion that knowledge and information are different, which is-- on which your argument hinges.
David Weinberger (role: against): In fact, let me-- the information itself is very suspect.
David Weinberger (role: against): Knowledge is not a filtering of information.
David Weinberger (role: against): And I also don't think knowledge works that way either.
David Weinberger (role: against): Wisdom doesn't make sense in that if you think about it for a moment.
David Weinberger (role: against): And certainly wisdom does not work that way.
David Weinberger (role: against): What's worthy information is-- in data becomes information and so on up the path.
David Weinberger (role: against): That gets filtered out.
David Weinberger (role: against): So we start with broad-based data.
David Weinberger (role: against): It's a pyramid because the idea is that knowledge is a matter-- we think knowledge is a matter of filtering out information.

David Weinberger (role: against): This is a pyramid that was constructed that was-- somebody came up with, Russell Ackoff, I think, in the 1990s.
David Weinberger (role: against): Well, on the one hand, I am not happy with the metaphorical use-- and yes, I am goading you, I think, Nick-- the metaphorical use of information, knowledge, and wisdom.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to see if you take that point or would refute it:
John Donvan (role: mod): But I-- it seems to me that your opponents are saying that information is not knowledge, and that there's an important distinction.
John Donvan (role: mod): You have celebrated the vast expansion of the amount of information out there.
John Donvan (role: mod): And it sounds to me-- I want to take this to David Weinberger.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to start more with the argument that was made about the impacts on the individual and his ability to gather and use knowledge.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I think we need to take some of those in turn.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I hear-- we've had many, many layers of this argument already brought out, both in terms of putting this in a hardware/software term, but we've also looked at the impact of the technology both on the individual and then on the culture.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they talked about, in general, the expansion of cultural knowledge, particularly in communities who previously didn't have ways to connect or had a voice, and that the technology gives them those voices.
John Donvan (role: mod): They hail the fact that the gatekeepers of knowledge are on the run and possibly in some cases dead.
John Donvan (role: mod): Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb The team arguing against the motion, Genevieve Bell and David Weinberger, argue that thanks to smart technology, we are living in a renaissance of knowledge, that being smart means being able to understand the world better, to be better at our work than ever before.
John Donvan (role: mod): They also make the case that smart technology creates a false ideal of intimacy which in itself is actually devoid of communication, and in that sense, harmful to the culture overall.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have made the argument that the new technology-- and we all know what we're talking about because it's in our pockets-- is creating a new environment of constant distraction and perpetual interruption which leads to a kind of cognitive overload, which ultimately diminishes attentiveness, and as a result, accumulation and use of knowledge suffers.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two debaters argue strenuously for the motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): The motion is this: Smart technology is making us dumb.
John Donvan (role: mod): And round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you and our live audience here in New York.

John Donvan (role: mod): But the description that Nicholas gives, from the sort of lab-- the bench science on this, do you find it concerning?
John Donvan (role: mod): And in either case, do you find it concerning?
Genevieve Bell (role: against): This technology is still relatively new.
Genevieve Bell (role: against): And I think, you know, one of the things that's very clear is that the first studies that were done about the impact of the Internet on our sociality, on our personalities, have long since been eclipsed by I'm thinking about that Sara Kiesler did at CMU, some of the other pieces of work, where some of the earlier assessments we made about how technology would affect people have now been proven, when you have more data, to be very different.
Genevieve Bell (role: against): And the impact of those, I think, is much more complex.
John Donvan (role: mod): Andrew Keen?
John Donvan (role: mod): Because again, you're more on the cultural topic, but I'm--
John Donvan (role: mod): --interested to see how you would process that.
Andrew Keen (role: for): We always hear this about these new technologies.
Andrew Keen (role: for): This is going to empower aboriginal people.
Andrew Keen (role: for): This is going to allow people to develop their economies.” And as we know, from the way in which they-- when it comes to politics, this technology was, as Genevieve says, is empowering, is liberating.
Andrew Keen (role: for): The Arab Spring was embraced by the digital utopians, because it was supposedly throwing off autocracy.
Andrew Keen (role: for): But what we've seen after the collapse of the Arab Spring is more anarchy.
Andrew Keen (role: for): We saw the same, indeed, with the Occupy movement in the United States.
Andrew Keen (role: for): It explodes.

Genevieve Bell (role: against): And I think, you know, the argument there is not about surveillance, but about, ""Does the prevalence of data always mean we are drowning?""
John Donvan (role: mod): We go into libraries and we skim and we select very quickly, and so he-- a direct challenge to your argument that this-- that this distraction that you talked about that the Internet represents is so problematic.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): We read in different ways, and they're all valuable.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): If you open a magazine or newspaper, you do a lot of skimming.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): You're actually reading.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): And what research into how people read when they're looking at their phones or their computer shows is that skimming becomes the default, the dominant form of reading.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): And then they go about halfway across the text, and then their eyes just drift down the rest of the margin, so it forms this F pattern.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): So skimming is fine in context.

Nicholas Carr (role: for): One group spends a lot of time online, a lot of time multi-tasking.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): They gave them six basic, fundamental tests of cognitive function.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): And one of the most revealing tests was how well people are able to distinguish important information from trivia.
Nicholas Carr (role: for): Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb And what the researchers theorized is that what happens is we train ourselves not to pay attention to what's important, but simply to pay attention to what's new.

Genevieve Bell (role: against): It doesn't always feel that way, but a lot of this technology has been in mainstream adoption in the United States for less than a decade.
Genevieve Bell (role: against): And then I think the second question is, I am also interested in what those studies look like beyond the United States, and about what it means to not keep reducing smart technology down to Facebook, Google, Twitter, and a phone, when in fact, we know that the technologies that are in people's worlds that are smart are far beyond that.

John Donvan (role: mod): --take it to your opponent that he actually refutes-- he refutes the assertion that knowledge and information are different, which is-- on which your argument hinges.
David Weinberger (role: against): In fact, let me-- the information itself is very suspect.
David Weinberger (role: against): Knowledge is not a filtering of information.

David Weinberger (role: against): Businesses put up, like every hour that diagram is drawn on some business law somewhere.

David Weinberger (role: against): Well, on the one hand, I am not happy with the metaphorical use-- and yes, I am goading you, I think, Nick-- the metaphorical use of information, knowledge, and wisdom.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to see if you take that point or would refute it:
John Donvan (role: mod): But I-- it seems to me that your opponents are saying that information is not knowledge, and that there's an important distinction.
John Donvan (role: mod): You have celebrated the vast expansion of the amount of information out there.
John Donvan (role: mod): And it sounds to me-- I want to take this to David Weinberger.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to start more with the argument that was made about the impacts on the individual and his ability to gather and use knowledge.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I think we need to take some of those in turn.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I hear-- we've had many, many layers of this argument already brought out, both in terms of putting this in a hardware/software term, but we've also looked at the impact of the technology both on the individual and then on the culture.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they talked about, in general, the expansion of cultural knowledge, particularly in communities who previously didn't have ways to connect or had a voice, and that the technology gives them those voices.
John Donvan (role: mod): They hail the fact that the gatekeepers of knowledge are on the run and possibly in some cases dead.
John Donvan (role: mod): Smart Technology is Making Us Dumb The team arguing against the motion, Genevieve Bell and David Weinberger, argue that thanks to smart technology, we are living in a renaissance of knowledge, that being smart means being able to understand the world better, to be better at our work than ever before.
John Donvan (role: mod): They also make the case that smart technology creates a false ideal of intimacy which in itself is actually devoid of communication, and in that sense, harmful to the culture overall.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have made the argument that the new technology-- and we all know what we're talking about because it's in our pockets-- is creating a new environment of constant distraction and perpetual interruption which leads to a kind of cognitive overload, which ultimately diminishes attentiveness, and as a result, accumulation and use of knowledge suffers.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two debaters argue strenuously for the motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): The motion is this: Smart technology is making us dumb.
John Donvan (role: mod): And round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you and our live audience here in New York.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now we move on to round two.

Andrew Keen (role: for): Smart Technology is Making Us DumbSo there is a double vulgarity here, and I would much rather talk about a big data economy than an information economy.
John Donvan (role: mod): And your opponent just said that-- that we are drowning in data, which would appear to try to set on its heels your argument that the plethora of stuff that we now have is in itself a good thing, because it's too much.
Genevieve Bell (role: against): I mean, you know, let's think about Snowden and Chelsea Manning.
Genevieve Bell (role: against): I mean, you know, whether we can argue about the legality of those, but the data that they generated revealed things about the contours of the world writ large and the world writ small, and made clear all manner of things that we might want as citizens, as human beings, as women to argue about.

David Frum (role: for): But the moment this—that terrorist actually enters the United States, that’s when the surveillance must stop.
David Frum (role: for): I mean I want—because I think what Bob—Bob Barr said is very important, notice he said he’s for enhanced foreign surveillance.
David Frum (role: for): May I have one—one sentence?
John Yoo (role: for): And when we defeat that organization the war will come to an end.
John Yoo (role: for): I think the problem is that we call it the war on terrorism so we think we’re at war with everyone who uses terrorism as a tactic, which is not the case, we are at war with the Al Qaeda terrorist organization, and organizations that help it.
John Yoo (role: for): Uh, there’ve been wars in, uh, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, with terrorists, and they have all come to an end.
John Yoo (role: for): Uh, there have been many wars between nation-states and terrorists before, and they have ended.
John Yoo (role: for): Chris, can— I just wanna take issue with the underlying premise of your question and, and Bob’s response which is there’s no reason to think the war on terrorism is going to be endless.
Chris Bury (role: mod): John.
Bob Barr (role: against): The greatest tool…to— with which the government ought to be equipped to avoid another 9/11 is not domestic surveillance, which is the topic at hand this evening, but better, more consistent gathering of foreign intelligence, and tearing down the walls between one agency and another that pre—have prevented and continue to stand in the way of effective use of that intelligence, that foreign intelligence.
Bob Barr (role: against): That is the great danger here.
Bob Barr (role: against): And this administration believes that a President can don that mythical commander-in-chief hat whenever he or she feels like it, and therefore, trumps any other power in the Constitution or law.
Bob Barr (role: against): It defines it as entirely global, that is, the streets of Baghdad are as much a field for the commander-in-chief to operate in as the streets of Atlanta, Georgia, nor your—or New York City.
Bob Barr (role: against): The current administration defines this war as unending, that is, perpetual.
Chris Bury (role: mod): Bob?
Andrew C. McCarthy (role: for): It’s a threat-time power, it’s an asymmetric war, uh, fought by a terrorist threat, and these measures are designed, uh, as much to thwart the threat as they are to prevail in the ultimate war.
Chris Bury (role: mod): So this is not a wartime power, you’re talking about permanent surveillance—
Andrew C. McCarthy (role: for): Well, of course it should because…the purpose of the power is to prevent attacks, and as long as the threat of attack exists, it would make no sense to get rid of the power.
Chris Bury (role: mod): If in fact the war on terror is a war that is not finite, but a war that may last for decades, if not centuries, should the government’s power…in such surveillance be open-ended, and I’d like a quick response and if, Bob, you wanna pick up on that very point.
Chris Bury (role: mod): You said that in an era of terror, that surveillance is the best defense that the country has.
Chris Bury (role: mod): Mr. McCarthy, I’d like you to, um, engage on a point, maybe with, with Bob Barr.
Chris Bury (role: mod): Members of the press, if you’re here tonight, please identify yourselves and your news organization, and members of the audience, you can opt out of, uh, that requirement.
Chris Bury (role: mod): We ask again that you please make your questions brief and refrain from, um, giving, uh, speeches.
Chris Bury (role: mod): The idea is to, uh, mix up some of your questions, some of my questions, and someone on each side of the auditorium will come to you with a microphone so please stand if you want to ask a question.
Chris Bury (role: mod): So we’re ready to begin the Q-and-A portion of the program.
Chris Bury (role: mod): Before the debate, 41 percent of you voted for the motion…37 percent voted against the motion, and 22 percent were undecided, rounding up all those numbers.

Jeffrey Rosen (role: against): It’s the dragnet searches that are, uh, threatening and, and the other side has provided no justification—
Chris Bury (role: mod): Let’s let the other side, John had a point here.
John Yoo (role: for): I think the other side thinks of it as a crime, and as best handled through the standard criminal justice system which is this probable cause approach.
John Yoo (role: for): What 9/11 showed us is that, our government is trying to act prospectively to stop terrorist attacks before they occur.
Nadine Strossen (role: against): And as—as John himself knows, that is absolutely not the standard, it is much watered down, as Andy said, the court has not applied the strict Fourth Amendment probable cause requirement in this context but required just some basis for suspicion.

David Frum (role: for): Okay, so the point is, you don’t—your answer is, no, we will not let people make that individual choice, we will not allow airlines and their customers as private actors to say, let’s, let’s put this to a truly personal individual trade-off test.
Jeffrey Rosen (role: against): And obviously people react, uh, intuitively to the place where the security hits them, so if they have to wait a little longer they’ll make the trade-off.

Chris Bury (role: mod): John.
John Yoo (role: for): Chris, can— I just wanna take issue with the underlying premise of your question and, and Bob’s response which is there’s no reason to think the war on terrorism is going to be endless.
John Yoo (role: for): Uh, there have been many wars between nation-states and terrorists before, and they have ended.
John Yoo (role: for): Uh, there’ve been wars in, uh, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, with terrorists, and they have all come to an end.
John Yoo (role: for): I think the problem is that we call it the war on terrorism so we think we’re at war with everyone who uses terrorism as a tactic, which is not the case, we are at war with the Al Qaeda terrorist organization, and organizations that help it.

Steve Forbes (role: against): Because the reason-- the reason, John, we got cars coming into this country starting in the late '60s was that unfortunately for a period of time the Germans and Japanese made a better car and people preferred that to what was being turned out in Detroit, which is how they got in trouble.
Steve Forbes (role: against): When other foreign companies came over and established car plants, they could turn out excellent cars.

James Grant (role: against): I’m older than you and I remember it very well.
James Grant (role: against): I can speak to the period of the 1890s.
John Donvan (role: mod): Jim Grant.
James Grant (role: against): I think that’s -
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): We completely agree that that’s the right way to run the economy.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): It’s when you don’t worry about what’s happening to the price level in your day to day decisions.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): The question is, can you actually get states stable inflation so you meet the definition of price stability, which Alan Greenspan I think said rightly so, is it’s like pornography, you know it when you see it.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): So there’s really an issue of technology here.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): Then we had the Klondike and South Africa and actually there was inflation, because there were huge amounts of gold found in the ground.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): So indeed we actually had a deflationary period in the 1880-- from 1880 to about 1896, because they couldn’t find any gold.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): Now what did happen in that period and one of the problems here was, that you actually very much affected by acts of God.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And in particular, this is a period where in fact there wasn’t a good dollar yardstick in the following sense, which is, the variability of inflation was much higher during the gold standard period than we have now.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): The problem is that you’re now in the vagaries of what happens to supply and demand for dollars.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): If you actually look at the gold standard period, one of the things that you see, is that when you tie the currency to gold and you say a dollar is worth let’s say 20 ounces, 20 dollars is worth ounce of gold for example, is what was done in that period.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): So let me give you reasons why.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And indeed, when we actually look at the technology of actually producing stable inflation, the idea that in fact we should go back to the horse and buggy and go back to the gold standard, I think doesn’t fly.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): I’m in no way advocating that.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And in that context, you’re absolutely right, that if you actually debauch the currency, if you have a lot of inflation, this is a very, very bad thing.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): But I, first I want to talk about, I think that there’s a sense jujitsu going on in that I actually strongly agree with the view that price stability should be the overriding long run-- overriding policy in the long run for monetary policy.

Frederic Mishkin (role: for): So the first thing I should tell you is, I actually am proud that I have a Ph.D. and that I’m a rocket scientist.

John Donvan (role: mod): And the government needs flexibility to work fiscal and economic policy.
John Donvan (role: mod): It hurts exports, and that hurts jobs, prosperity.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have told us that you need a dollar that matches the economic times that you're in, and sometimes like the president, they say a strong dollar actually hurts.

John Donvan (role: mod): All right Jim, let me step in for a moment because you actually made that point in your opening statement.
John Donvan (role: mod): And what I want to do is break down some of the points that were made in the opening statements.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I asked you a question Fred, Rick, that you didn’t answer, and I’m very sensitive to that reality.

John Donvan (role: mod): Can you respond to that directly?
John Donvan (role: mod): Then I want Steve to--
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): Workers do better when there is low and stable inflation, that we agree on.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And in fact, low and stable inflation means that it’s not fluctuating a lot.
John Donvan (role: mod): So what is he saying that’s different from what you believe?
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): Because what he’s saying that’s different is that he wants a fixed value of the currency, the dollar, in terms of a commodity, let’s say gold.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And that actually is not a situation where it produces stability in the price level.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): During the gold standard, the price level went up, went down.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): Now you are right, that over very long rises, over 40 year period, there was no change in price level.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): That’s the good news.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): The bad news is, that horizons are not 40 years.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): As Cain said, in the long run, we’re all dead.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay, Steve Forbes.
John Donvan (role: mod): Back to your point.
John Donvan (role: mod): Bring us some examples or make the case in specific terms about the stable currency being good for workers.
Steve Forbes (role: against): Well again, what prices do is, should be determined by a free market.
Steve Forbes (role: against): You take an iPod today.
Steve Forbes (role: against): Ten years ago, it would have cost $10,000.
Steve Forbes (role: against): So in terms of the free markets, prices may go up, may go down.
Steve Forbes (role: against): Again, the money should be stable in value.
Steve Forbes (role: against): We surpassed our neighbors in Latin America.
Steve Forbes (role: against): And one of the key things that Hamilton and Washington brought in was realizing if you fool around with the money, what that does is hurts commerce.

James Grant (role: against): Which is not price stability, it’s--
James Grant (role: against): So what we have is persistent credit bubbles, in the name of what they are pleased to call price stability.
James Grant (role: against): The Fed insists on creating that amount of dollars that will deliver unto us that measure of inflation the Fed thinks we need, namely two percent, which by the way, they can’t really measure.
James Grant (role: against): The Fed will have none of it.
James Grant (role: against): Therefore prices might benignly fall.
James Grant (role: against): Well prices, I would suppose dwindle, the supply curve is shifting downward and to the right.
James Grant (role: against): What will you expect price to do?
James Grant (role: against): We can’t keep up with the rate of gain in productivity.
James Grant (role: against): In which marvels of engineering shove each other out of the news every day.
James Grant (role: against): In which digital technology breaks down the barriers to production the world over.
James Grant (role: against): Now, what will you expect prices to do in a world of technological wonder in which hundreds of millions of willing new hands are added to the world’s labor force?
James Grant (role: against): The Fed means to create this amount of credit such that prices do not dwindle, fall, weaken.
James Grant (role: against): Most Americans spend most of the weekend looking for the thing the Fed deplores.
James Grant (role: against): You, ladies and gentleman, might know this as every day low and lower prices.
James Grant (role: against): The Fed has its knives out for the thing they are pleased to call deflation.
James Grant (role: against): And your critique of the gold standard, if I may say, I think, reveals some of the weaknesses of the Federal Reserve’s approach to our monetary affairs of the present day.
James Grant (role: against): I’m older than you and I remember it very well.
James Grant (role: against): I can speak to the period of the 1890s.
John Donvan (role: mod): Jim Grant.
James Grant (role: against): I think that’s -
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): We completely agree that that’s the right way to run the economy.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): It’s when you don’t worry about what’s happening to the price level in your day to day decisions.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): The question is, can you actually get states stable inflation so you meet the definition of price stability, which Alan Greenspan I think said rightly so, is it’s like pornography, you know it when you see it.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): So there’s really an issue of technology here.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): Then we had the Klondike and South Africa and actually there was inflation, because there were huge amounts of gold found in the ground.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): So indeed we actually had a deflationary period in the 1880-- from 1880 to about 1896, because they couldn’t find any gold.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): Now what did happen in that period and one of the problems here was, that you actually very much affected by acts of God.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And in particular, this is a period where in fact there wasn’t a good dollar yardstick in the following sense, which is, the variability of inflation was much higher during the gold standard period than we have now.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): The problem is that you’re now in the vagaries of what happens to supply and demand for dollars.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): If you actually look at the gold standard period, one of the things that you see, is that when you tie the currency to gold and you say a dollar is worth let’s say 20 ounces, 20 dollars is worth ounce of gold for example, is what was done in that period.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): So let me give you reasons why.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And indeed, when we actually look at the technology of actually producing stable inflation, the idea that in fact we should go back to the horse and buggy and go back to the gold standard, I think doesn’t fly.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): I’m in no way advocating that.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And in that context, you’re absolutely right, that if you actually debauch the currency, if you have a lot of inflation, this is a very, very bad thing.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): But I, first I want to talk about, I think that there’s a sense jujitsu going on in that I actually strongly agree with the view that price stability should be the overriding long run-- overriding policy in the long run for monetary policy.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): What can I tell you.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): So the first thing I should tell you is, I actually am proud that I have a Ph.D. and that I’m a rocket scientist.
John Donvan (role: mod): Steve Forbes is saying workers do better with a strong dollar policy.
John Donvan (role: mod): You’re arguing that America doesn’t need a strong dollar policy.

John Donvan (role: mod): I want to put that question to their opponents.
John Donvan (role: mod): They said specifically, workers do better when the economy is stable, and workers-- the workers do better when the currency is stable, and worse when it's not.
John Donvan (role: mod): When that doesn’t happen, when your 12 inch ruler doesn't have 12 inches anymore, the meaning of money begins to slip out of sight.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against, and that means they're arguing for a strong dollar, James Grant and Steve Forbes, are arguing, yes, we do need a strong dollar, that a strong dollar is one that is fixed, that money was invented to represent and hold value so that business could be done.
John Donvan (role: mod): And the government needs flexibility to work fiscal and economic policy.
John Donvan (role: mod): It hurts exports, and that hurts jobs, prosperity.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have told us that you need a dollar that matches the economic times that you're in, and sometimes like the president, they say a strong dollar actually hurts.
John Donvan (role: mod): Arguing in support of that motion, in other words arguing against a strong dollar policy, we have Fred Mishkin and John Taylor.
John Donvan (role: mod): Our motion is, America doesn't need a strong dollar policy.

Frederic Mishkin (role: for): Then we had the Klondike and South Africa and actually there was inflation, because there were huge amounts of gold found in the ground.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): So indeed we actually had a deflationary period in the 1880-- from 1880 to about 1896, because they couldn’t find any gold.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): Now what did happen in that period and one of the problems here was, that you actually very much affected by acts of God.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And in particular, this is a period where in fact there wasn’t a good dollar yardstick in the following sense, which is, the variability of inflation was much higher during the gold standard period than we have now.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): The problem is that you’re now in the vagaries of what happens to supply and demand for dollars.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): If you actually look at the gold standard period, one of the things that you see, is that when you tie the currency to gold and you say a dollar is worth let’s say 20 ounces, 20 dollars is worth ounce of gold for example, is what was done in that period.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): So let me give you reasons why.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And indeed, when we actually look at the technology of actually producing stable inflation, the idea that in fact we should go back to the horse and buggy and go back to the gold standard, I think doesn’t fly.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): I’m in no way advocating that.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And in that context, you’re absolutely right, that if you actually debauch the currency, if you have a lot of inflation, this is a very, very bad thing.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): But I, first I want to talk about, I think that there’s a sense jujitsu going on in that I actually strongly agree with the view that price stability should be the overriding long run-- overriding policy in the long run for monetary policy.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): What can I tell you.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): So the first thing I should tell you is, I actually am proud that I have a Ph.D. and that I’m a rocket scientist.
John Donvan (role: mod): Steve Forbes is saying workers do better with a strong dollar policy.
John Donvan (role: mod): You’re arguing that America doesn’t need a strong dollar policy.

John Donvan (role: mod): I want to put that question to their opponents.
John Donvan (role: mod): They said specifically, workers do better when the economy is stable, and workers-- the workers do better when the currency is stable, and worse when it's not.
John Donvan (role: mod): When that doesn’t happen, when your 12 inch ruler doesn't have 12 inches anymore, the meaning of money begins to slip out of sight.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against, and that means they're arguing for a strong dollar, James Grant and Steve Forbes, are arguing, yes, we do need a strong dollar, that a strong dollar is one that is fixed, that money was invented to represent and hold value so that business could be done.
John Donvan (role: mod): And the government needs flexibility to work fiscal and economic policy.
John Donvan (role: mod): It hurts exports, and that hurts jobs, prosperity.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have told us that you need a dollar that matches the economic times that you're in, and sometimes like the president, they say a strong dollar actually hurts.
John Donvan (role: mod): Arguing in support of that motion, in other words arguing against a strong dollar policy, we have Fred Mishkin and John Taylor.
John Donvan (role: mod): Our motion is, America doesn't need a strong dollar policy.
John Donvan (role: mod): Here's where we stand at the beginning of round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): And now on to round two, where the debaters address each other directly and also answer questions from me and from you in the audience.

Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And if you have an inflation rate which is too low, then you're actually in a situation where you get deep deflation, something that you think is not a problem, but I can tell you, when you look at history and ask when we've had the worst crises, and the worst recessions, and the worst depressions, they were always associated with deflation.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): So you actually want to protect against not having too high inflation and not having too low.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): You'd like to drive the federal funds rate negative, and you can't do it, and, therefore, you can't stimulate the economy enough.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And what it tells you is you want to have a deflation rate which is, one, not so high that you spend a lot of time actually making decisions about where the price level's going to be, but instead produce, which produces a good economy, but secondly not so low that you end up in a situation where you get deflations, where you get this situation where you can't do expansionary policy when you need it, and as a result you have to pick a number in between.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 10.0, 'undecided_for': 26.0, 'for_against': 6.0, 'for_for': 17.0, 'undecided_against': 12.0, 'for_undecided': 0.0, 'undecided_undecided': 8.0, 'against_undecided': 2.0, 'against_against': 19.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 9.0, 'for': 54.0, 'against': 37.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 47.0, 'for': 24.0, 'against': 29.0}}",John Donvan,mod,Let me step in because I did you kill him because I don't think you killed him.

Frederic Mishkin (role: for): During the gold standard, the price level went up, went down.

Steve Forbes (role: against): You take an iPod today.

Steve Forbes (role: against): We surpassed our neighbors in Latin America.
Steve Forbes (role: against): And one of the key things that Hamilton and Washington brought in was realizing if you fool around with the money, what that does is hurts commerce.

John Taylor (role: for): But--
John Taylor (role: for): Yeah, but I just wonder.
John Taylor (role: for): The fact is, is that the example that Jim gave, where the Asians were beginning to develop products at cheaper prices and all this kind of stuff, implied a decline in U.S. wages.
John Taylor (role: for): And so I believe that, in fact, the movement to a weak dollar had a lot to do with the fact that we had a growth in Asia coming, and product was coming in much cheaper and basically undercutting, well, not only Detroit, but California, and the-- if you look at apples, or whatever, they're-- none of them are made in the United States, right?

Frederic Mishkin (role: for): I want to change this issue a little bit, that--
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): No, no, I want to deal with the question in the following sense, which is that what goes on in the real economy is actually much less associated with what goes on in terms of the inflation that in fact you're attributing it to, and in particular, that a lot of things you've talked about in terms of high growth and so forth, or whether you have good institutions, a good legal system, and so forth, so what we really need to focus on is a narrower issue that-- does a strong dollar actually help the economy?
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): Does having a good dollar yardstick help the economy?
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): I think that's very important, but not-- let's not get into this view that having a strong dollar, or gold standard, or weak dollar actually solves all of our problems.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): It's still important.
John Donvan (role: mod): Jim Grant.
John Donvan (role: mod): Are you arguing that?

Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And also the fiscal irresponsibility, but this is a choice of the governments are spending too much relative to what they take in.
James Grant (role: against): That's why they're 2 percent the world over.
James Grant (role: against): They had strictures, they had a system within which they had to run their affairs.
James Grant (role: against): And it's not-- as John himself said, it's not going to end well.
John Taylor (role: for): I think that there's an argument being made here that what happened in the '70s is what's happening today, and there's an argument being made, also, that we cannot manage ourselves, our money, without having some Procrustean bed that we're forced into.
John Taylor (role: for): I think that's really our point, is that you have be flexible; the dollar has period where it needs to be strong.

Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And in fact, low and stable inflation means that it’s not fluctuating a lot.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): Workers do better when there is low and stable inflation, that we agree on.
John Donvan (role: mod): Then I want Steve to--
John Donvan (role: mod): Can you respond to that directly?
John Donvan (role: mod): Steve’s point that workers do better when a currency is stable and worse when it’s not.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I asked you a question Fred, Rick, that you didn’t answer, and I’m very sensitive to that reality.
John Donvan (role: mod): And what I want to do is break down some of the points that were made in the opening statements.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right Jim, let me step in for a moment because you actually made that point in your opening statement.
James Grant (role: against): Which is not price stability, it’s--
James Grant (role: against): So what we have is persistent credit bubbles, in the name of what they are pleased to call price stability.
James Grant (role: against): The Fed insists on creating that amount of dollars that will deliver unto us that measure of inflation the Fed thinks we need, namely two percent, which by the way, they can’t really measure.
James Grant (role: against): The Fed will have none of it.
James Grant (role: against): Therefore prices might benignly fall.
James Grant (role: against): Well prices, I would suppose dwindle, the supply curve is shifting downward and to the right.
James Grant (role: against): What will you expect price to do?
James Grant (role: against): We can’t keep up with the rate of gain in productivity.
James Grant (role: against): In which marvels of engineering shove each other out of the news every day.
James Grant (role: against): In which digital technology breaks down the barriers to production the world over.
James Grant (role: against): Now, what will you expect prices to do in a world of technological wonder in which hundreds of millions of willing new hands are added to the world’s labor force?
James Grant (role: against): The Fed means to create this amount of credit such that prices do not dwindle, fall, weaken.
James Grant (role: against): Most Americans spend most of the weekend looking for the thing the Fed deplores.
James Grant (role: against): You, ladies and gentleman, might know this as every day low and lower prices.
James Grant (role: against): The Fed has its knives out for the thing they are pleased to call deflation.
James Grant (role: against): And your critique of the gold standard, if I may say, I think, reveals some of the weaknesses of the Federal Reserve’s approach to our monetary affairs of the present day.
James Grant (role: against): I’m older than you and I remember it very well.
James Grant (role: against): I can speak to the period of the 1890s.
John Donvan (role: mod): Jim Grant.
James Grant (role: against): I think that’s -
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): We completely agree that that’s the right way to run the economy.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): It’s when you don’t worry about what’s happening to the price level in your day to day decisions.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): The question is, can you actually get states stable inflation so you meet the definition of price stability, which Alan Greenspan I think said rightly so, is it’s like pornography, you know it when you see it.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): So there’s really an issue of technology here.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): Then we had the Klondike and South Africa and actually there was inflation, because there were huge amounts of gold found in the ground.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): So indeed we actually had a deflationary period in the 1880-- from 1880 to about 1896, because they couldn’t find any gold.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): Now what did happen in that period and one of the problems here was, that you actually very much affected by acts of God.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And in particular, this is a period where in fact there wasn’t a good dollar yardstick in the following sense, which is, the variability of inflation was much higher during the gold standard period than we have now.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): The problem is that you’re now in the vagaries of what happens to supply and demand for dollars.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): If you actually look at the gold standard period, one of the things that you see, is that when you tie the currency to gold and you say a dollar is worth let’s say 20 ounces, 20 dollars is worth ounce of gold for example, is what was done in that period.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): So let me give you reasons why.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And indeed, when we actually look at the technology of actually producing stable inflation, the idea that in fact we should go back to the horse and buggy and go back to the gold standard, I think doesn’t fly.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): I’m in no way advocating that.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): And in that context, you’re absolutely right, that if you actually debauch the currency, if you have a lot of inflation, this is a very, very bad thing.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): But I, first I want to talk about, I think that there’s a sense jujitsu going on in that I actually strongly agree with the view that price stability should be the overriding long run-- overriding policy in the long run for monetary policy.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): What can I tell you.
Frederic Mishkin (role: for): So the first thing I should tell you is, I actually am proud that I have a Ph.D. and that I’m a rocket scientist.
John Donvan (role: mod): Steve Forbes is saying workers do better with a strong dollar policy.
John Donvan (role: mod): You’re arguing that America doesn’t need a strong dollar policy.
John Donvan (role: mod): To Ric Mishkin.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to put that question to their opponents.
John Donvan (role: mod): They said specifically, workers do better when the economy is stable, and workers-- the workers do better when the currency is stable, and worse when it's not.
John Donvan (role: mod): When that doesn’t happen, when your 12 inch ruler doesn't have 12 inches anymore, the meaning of money begins to slip out of sight.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against, and that means they're arguing for a strong dollar, James Grant and Steve Forbes, are arguing, yes, we do need a strong dollar, that a strong dollar is one that is fixed, that money was invented to represent and hold value so that business could be done.
John Donvan (role: mod): And the government needs flexibility to work fiscal and economic policy.
John Donvan (role: mod): It hurts exports, and that hurts jobs, prosperity.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have told us that you need a dollar that matches the economic times that you're in, and sometimes like the president, they say a strong dollar actually hurts.
John Donvan (role: mod): Arguing in support of that motion, in other words arguing against a strong dollar policy, we have Fred Mishkin and John Taylor.
John Donvan (role: mod): Our motion is, America doesn't need a strong dollar policy.
John Donvan (role: mod): Here's where we stand at the beginning of round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): And now on to round two, where the debaters address each other directly and also answer questions from me and from you in the audience.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.

Steve Forbes (role: against): We’ve had a huge fall in the price of memory.
Steve Forbes (role: against): Memory costs what, $40, $50?
Steve Forbes (role: against): So as Jim said, with productivity prices might go down, which is good for us.
Steve Forbes (role: against): You have a drought, they'll go up.
Steve Forbes (role: against): The United States, from the time we went on the gold standard in 1789 right through-- some on and offs, through '71, had one of the most extraordinary growth periods in human history.
Steve Forbes (role: against): We surpassed Europe in terms of growth, which is why we attracted more immigrants than any other country in the world where it seems a place of opportunity.
Steve Forbes (role: against): People hold physical assets instead of going out, and doing, and investing in the future.
Steve Forbes (role: against): That's risky, but it's even riskier, and you're less likely to do it, if you don't know what you're going to be paid back in.

James Grant (role: against): Look, inflation is a defined term.
James Grant (role: against): The inflation in house prices almost brought this country, financially speaking, down.
James Grant (role: against): Unbeknownst to the Fed and hundreds of monetary scholars on the payroll, some of them whom I’d keep by the way, just for the sake of equity.
James Grant (role: against): Now inflation is not a certain threshold reading on a CPI inflation, it’s too much money.
James Grant (role: against): Now it could be inflation of the checkout counter, that was 1970, but you must keep up, right John?
James Grant (role: against): Because by the way, the rich get richer in a regime of low interest rates, and they get richer big.

Frederic Mishkin (role: for): Again, the issue is, you’re right, the bubbles can be very disastrous, particularly ones that involve credit markets.

Margaret Mellon (role: against): I also want to say how, you no he, we need to use all our tools.
Margaret Mellon (role: against): I mean, since, or well before genetic engineering came on the scene, traditional breeders and agronomists were able to produce 1 to 2 percent a year increases in corn and soybean yields in this country for decades.
Margaret Mellon (role: against): All the way through the biotech era, we have continued to get 1 to 2 percent yields decade after decade.

Robert Fraley (role: for): You know, I run the research program for Monsanto.
Robert Fraley (role: for): Absolutely plant breeding particularly assisted by these molecular tools has a great opportunity and has a huge impact internationally.
John Donvan (role: mod): Well, Rob, one-- one part of-- I think of Margaret's argument is that the focus on genetically engineered crops sort of sucks the oxygen out of the room and sort of integrates interest in more conventional methods, which she says would substitute perfectly well for genetic engineering.
Robert Fraley (role: for): You know, I think the debate around GMO crops sucks all the air out of the room.

Alison Van Eenennaam (role: for): And I think it's that the effective of BT crops has been a dramatic reduction in insecticide use, especially in the developing world.

Charles Benbrook (role: against): Okay, so a farmer has a field of corn, soybeans, cotton, and weeds come up.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): But--
John Donvan (role: mod): Or one of them was called Roundup.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): And in 1996, the first genetically engineered so-called herbicide tolerant crop came on the market.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): It would kill the corn without the gene.
John Donvan (role: mod): And not kill their corn.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): But what's happened is in the early years, it worked great.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): And scientists that warned about this happening before they were developed-- and even predicted it would take about five years-- there it was.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): By 2004, we had six or eight different serious Glyphosate resistant weeds, mostly in the southeast, including this Palmer Amaranth that the roots of it-- the stock of it can get as big as a person's wrist.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): And now there's like a hundred-- a hundred million acres--
John Donvan (role: mod): How did those weeds get to be resistant to Roundup?
Charles Benbrook (role: against): When you spray one herbicide over and over again on weeds, they're going to develop resistance.
John Donvan (role: mod): I just wanted people to understand.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, I want to take that to Rob Fraley.
Robert Fraley (role: for): Yeah, let me reel all the way back in terms of the herbicide tolerant crops and the benefits they provided.
Robert Fraley (role: for): The big benefit of Roundup ready crops is it gave farmers the ability to use Roundup.
Robert Fraley (role: for): I mean, it's very effective.
Robert Fraley (role: for): It's generally regarded as the gold standard.
Robert Fraley (role: for): But the huge benefit, and absolutely the huge benefit of herbicide tolerant crops has been the fact that it has basically eliminated tillage.
Robert Fraley (role: for): We don't expose that dirt to evaporation of the moisture.

John Donvan (role: mod): Now on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): Round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you at our live audience here in New York.
John Donvan (role: mod): Our motion is this: ""Genetically Modify Food"".
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing for the motion, Robert Fraley and Alison Van Eenennaam, have argued that genetic engineering of food is no Holy Grail, but that it is a tool that can be used to help an enormous number of people.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say the proof of this is the fact that farmers have been using it because, in fact, it works for them.
John Donvan (role: mod): She says their safety has been established over 20 years without a single known injury related to the consumption of genetically engineered food, that the studies are a waterfall of support for this argument and also for the benefits themselves of genetically engineered food.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they talk about the possibilities in the future of plants that can crush, absolutely crush plant disease and survive, which would be better for all.
John Donvan (role: mod): It's a lot of promise about the future.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Margaret Mellon and Chuck Benbrook, they're saying, don't look at the future.
John Donvan (role: mod): Look at the present.
John Donvan (role: mod): And their argument is that so far, genetically engineered food has not lived up to its promise.
John Donvan (role: mod): It's pulled off a couple of very neat and important tricks, but not all that was promised in the beginning.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say that they're not necessary, that they are not proven safe and that in fact contrary to the other side's assertions that there is no consensus on their safety.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go first to the safety question and take the argument back to Chuck Benbrook who just completed your opening statements.
John Donvan (role: mod): Chuck, you said that there is no consensus on this.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponents have actually framed the statement that there's no scientific consensus on the safety of genetically modified food as being akin to people challenging the science behind global warming, that-- that you have-- they didn't literally say this, but you have to be a little bit of a crank not to-- not to buy the science.
John Donvan (role: mod): What's your response to that?
Charles Benbrook (role: against): I've read essentially all the statements by various bodies.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): And here's what they essentially all say.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): They use slightly different words.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): They say the genetic engineering of food as a technology does not create any new or different potential risks in the modified foods that other forms of plant breeding don't.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): Several of the reports, including both of the two National Academy of Sciences reports that specifically address this say that there is a possibility that genetically engineered foods may pose higher risk of that nature, but we really don't know.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): They also all say that there's no convincing evidence now or at this point that there's been acute health problems in the U.S. population from the consumption of genetically engineered foods.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): And then they all go on to call for further investment in the development of more sensitive, scientific techniques to assess the possibile risks, and they also call for post approval surveillance.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): Most of the recommendations for better science, more careful risk assessment and post market surveillance that have been made for over 15 years, in these reports have not been acted upon--
John Donvan (role: mod): All right, let's--
Charles Benbrook (role: against): --in the U.S.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's let your opponent, Robert Fraley respond.
Robert Fraley (role: for): So, first of all, you know, don't want to repeat what I said earlier, but, you know, this science is-- has been around literally since the 1970s and had broad applicability to health and agriculture with an impressive safety record.

Robert Fraley (role: for): That's because it's inherent that we've been moving genes from the beginning of time, but also, I just want to illustrate how important the regulatory oversight has been.
Robert Fraley (role: for): Chuck and I first met when we put in place the USDA EPA and FDA oversight, which is still the gold standard around the world.
Robert Fraley (role: for): But every country that we ship corn or soybeans to around the world has already done their independent health and safety assessments as well as literally thousands of academic studies that all point to the same conclusion that's been codified by every major science organization around the world.

Robert Fraley (role: for): So, first of all, you know, don't want to repeat what I said earlier, but, you know, this science is-- has been around literally since the 1970s and had broad applicability to health and agriculture with an impressive safety record.
Robert Fraley (role: for): I mean, not a single issue of animal or human safety with the technology.
Robert Fraley (role: for): That's because it's inherent that we've been moving genes from the beginning of time, but also, I just want to illustrate how important the regulatory oversight has been.
Robert Fraley (role: for): Chuck and I first met when we put in place the USDA EPA and FDA oversight, which is still the gold standard around the world.
Robert Fraley (role: for): But every country that we ship corn or soybeans to around the world has already done their independent health and safety assessments as well as literally thousands of academic studies that all point to the same conclusion that's been codified by every major science organization around the world.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right, let me stop you for a second.
Robert Fraley (role: for): These products are safe.
John Donvan (role: mod): I just want to ask Margaret Mellon, do you concede that point, or do you refute it?
Margaret Mellon (role: against): No, I do not concede it.
John Donvan (role: mod): So what-- what's wrong about his facts then?
John Donvan (role: mod): No, no, but the thrust of the argument-- and then you can go on for your point--
John Donvan (role: mod): --the thrust of his argument is that there has been an enormous amount of vetting going on at government levels around the world and that this in itself would act as a safety net, do you refute that, that sort of vetting is going on?

John Donvan (role: mod): Robert, I did say I'd let you come back to your point.
Robert Fraley (role: for): Sure.
Robert Fraley (role: for): Let me just make the point.
Robert Fraley (role: for): We are the breadbasket to the world.
Robert Fraley (role: for): The point I was trying to make on the safety studies is each of these genes is regulated, individually looked at, and they are also looked at collectively, and there is no reason to believe that they have any concern in terms of stacking them together.
Robert Fraley (role: for): You actually reminded me that the best way to bring this technology into the marketplace was to bring multiple products together so we had more durability and better insect protection.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): Yes, that-- that's true.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): But the problem is we know that insects, they-- they have the ability-- once they develop resistance to one BT protein, it becomes much easier and quicker to develop resistance to others.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): So while having multiple BT proteins in there sort of sounds like a good idea, it's already not playing out as planned.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): On an acre of corn, the six different BT proteins add up to 3.7 pounds of the Bioinsecticide that's inside that corn.

Robert Fraley (role: for): Roundup controls hundreds of weeds.

Charles Benbrook (role: against): They use slightly different words.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): They say the genetic engineering of food as a technology does not create any new or different potential risks in the modified foods that other forms of plant breeding don't.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): Several of the reports, including both of the two National Academy of Sciences reports that specifically address this say that there is a possibility that genetically engineered foods may pose higher risk of that nature, but we really don't know.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): They also all say that there's no convincing evidence now or at this point that there's been acute health problems in the U.S. population from the consumption of genetically engineered foods.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): And then they all go on to call for further investment in the development of more sensitive, scientific techniques to assess the possibile risks, and they also call for post approval surveillance.
Charles Benbrook (role: against): Most of the recommendations for better science, more careful risk assessment and post market surveillance that have been made for over 15 years, in these reports have not been acted upon--
John Donvan (role: mod): All right, let's--
Charles Benbrook (role: against): --in the U.S.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's let your opponent, Robert Fraley respond.
Robert Fraley (role: for): So, first of all, you know, don't want to repeat what I said earlier, but, you know, this science is-- has been around literally since the 1970s and had broad applicability to health and agriculture with an impressive safety record.
Robert Fraley (role: for): I mean, not a single issue of animal or human safety with the technology.
Robert Fraley (role: for): That's because it's inherent that we've been moving genes from the beginning of time, but also, I just want to illustrate how important the regulatory oversight has been.
Robert Fraley (role: for): Chuck and I first met when we put in place the USDA EPA and FDA oversight, which is still the gold standard around the world.
Robert Fraley (role: for): But every country that we ship corn or soybeans to around the world has already done their independent health and safety assessments as well as literally thousands of academic studies that all point to the same conclusion that's been codified by every major science organization around the world.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right, let me stop you for a second.
Robert Fraley (role: for): These products are safe.
John Donvan (role: mod): I just want to ask Margaret Mellon, do you concede that point, or do you refute it?
Margaret Mellon (role: against): No, I do not concede it.

John Donvan (role: mod): Chuck, you said that there is no consensus on this.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go first to the safety question and take the argument back to Chuck Benbrook who just completed your opening statements.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say that they're not necessary, that they are not proven safe and that in fact contrary to the other side's assertions that there is no consensus on their safety.
John Donvan (role: mod): It's pulled off a couple of very neat and important tricks, but not all that was promised in the beginning.
John Donvan (role: mod): And their argument is that so far, genetically engineered food has not lived up to its promise.
John Donvan (role: mod): Look at the present.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Margaret Mellon and Chuck Benbrook, they're saying, don't look at the future.
John Donvan (role: mod): It's a lot of promise about the future.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they talk about the possibilities in the future of plants that can crush, absolutely crush plant disease and survive, which would be better for all.
John Donvan (role: mod): She says their safety has been established over 20 years without a single known injury related to the consumption of genetically engineered food, that the studies are a waterfall of support for this argument and also for the benefits themselves of genetically engineered food.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say the proof of this is the fact that farmers have been using it because, in fact, it works for them.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing for the motion, Robert Fraley and Alison Van Eenennaam, have argued that genetic engineering of food is no Holy Grail, but that it is a tool that can be used to help an enormous number of people.
John Donvan (role: mod): Our motion is this: ""Genetically Modify Food"".

John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our motion is ""Genetically Modify Food.""
Margaret Mellon (role: against): Well, I think that there is agreement that there is no evidence that the current applications of genetic engineering have dramatic acute short term--
Margaret Mellon (role: against): Yeah, sure.
Margaret Mellon (role: against): I think that there's a lot of review that's going on, and I think that it is focused on the point that I've just made, that there are no acute dramatic effects of the consumption of genetically modified organisms.

John Donvan (role: mod): So we've discussed safety.
John Donvan (role: mod): But the impact on the environment.
John Donvan (role: mod): What's your response to that?
Alison Van Eenennaam (role: for): And I think it's that the effective of BT crops has been a dramatic reduction in insecticide use, especially in the developing world.
Alison Van Eenennaam (role: for): So I think that, particularly BT crops have led to reduced use of insecticides.

Paul Helmke (role: against): His argument is that you can’t sue them if they haven’t responded
Paul Helmke (role: against): And let me address that argument, it’s Steve’s argument, at some extent, is true.
Paul Helmke (role: against): The Supreme Court made that very clear in the Heller case, you know, I do wonder a little bit about Justice Roberts’s comments that he wasn’t, you know, he wanted to be able to shoot his gun but he needed to turn on the light and put on his reading glasses before that, and that’s the example Steve just gave and I thought gee, if the Chief Justice needs to put on his glasses and turn the light on before he can shoot maybe, he shouldn’t be shooting, but— It gets into the issue of, yes, people do have a—
Paul Helmke (role: against): But what we do when we live in communities is we set up police departments because they’re the individuals that are trained, they’re the individuals that respond.
Paul Helmke (role: against): Homes with more guns have more gun violence, cities with more guns have more gun violence, states with more guns, countries with more guns, more gun violence, now that includes gun suicides and gun accidents, not just gun homicides.

John R. Lott (role: for): And, that’s precisely what you want to do, you don’t want to just compare across places because, you know, Idaho is different than California and England has a different underlying crime rate before they change any types of gun control laws than the United States has.
John R. Lott (role: for): And there are lots of other things you’ll do, you’ll see, as that state issues more permits, you know, is there a greater drop that you see…Stephen Halbrook was just mentioning is the probability that a criminal may come across somebody who’s able to defend themselves, is there some relationship between the increased risk that the criminal faces and, and further drops in crime.

Paul Helmke (role: against): In other states it actually goes to the Chief of Police or to the Sheriff, who does a check to see whether you—not only is your record clean but, in terms of the felony conviction, but they check to see are the police responding to your house every week because of domestic quarrels, is this a kid that you’ve had to arrest a number of times on minor things that aren’t going to be a disqualifier.
Paul Helmke (role: against): It was questionable whether he should’ve been acquitted, it was one of those cases.
Paul Helmke (role: against): Right now, 48 of the 50 states have some version of either may issue or shall issue, so it’s hard to make comparisons between states that do and don’t have these things—
R. Gil Kerlikowske (role: against): I will, I think the issue for us is clearly that there has to be far more than being mobile and not being blind as a reason to give someone a firearms permit.
R. Gil Kerlikowske (role: against): And in the middle of this crowd he looked at someone, that person looked at him and they got into a fight, the gun went off and it not only discharged across the assailant, the person that he was fighting with--and all they’d been fighting with were their hands--the gun also then ended up going through the hand of a young man and into the thigh of another woman.
R. Gil Kerlikowske (role: against): On the issue of gun buy-backs I think the research is pretty clear, does it deter crime, does it result in guns being taken off the street that are crime guns… A lot of times they’re old guns, they’re guns that are not being used in crimes and they’re being found by people cleaning out garages, et cetera.
R. Gil Kerlikowske (role: against): But I don’t think we see it as a huge issue as far as reducing crime.
John R. Lott (role: for): On the gun buy-back issue, I don’t know of one single academic study by any type of academic, that finds that they reduce any type of violent crime rate.
John R. Lott (role: for): And it’s easy to check.
John R. Lott (role: for): The type of incident that there was, this wounding, is the only case I know like that in the state of Washington, nobody has been convicted of murder for example in Washington that’s had a concealed-carry permit, and you’re talking about almost 50 years.
John R. Lott (role: for): In Florida, you can go to the website for the department that issues permits, and they have detailed data there, you find that, from October 1987 through September 31st of this year, they had issued over 1.41 million permits to 1.41 million people.

Gary Kleck (role: for): Indeed you would—
R. Gil Kerlikowske (role: against): That probably is quite correct.
R. Gil Kerlikowske (role: against): So to say yes, one out of what, but what, 45 officers killed, shot—
John R. Lott (role: for): So the ratio—
John R. Lott (role: for): Yeah, you’re talking about at most five a year or so, even in the high years that that is.
John R. Lott (role: for): And so if you’re asking, what’s the rate of a police officer who’s assaulted, who’s going to lose control of his weapon and have it used against him—and going to result in his death, it’s a tiny number, but even more important I think to make is a comparison to civilians, because that’s partly the motivation for this.
John R. Lott (role: for): If he has to come into physical contact with the criminal, and you’re much more likely to have something go wrong.
John R. Lott (role: for): Your job isn’t to go and arrest people.
John R. Lott (role: for): If he runs away, that’s basically what you’re done with, and that’s the reason why you had the gun.
Paul Helmke (role: against): Yeah, I—
Paul Helmke (role: against): It’s— I think Steve’s playing legalisms with what really happens, I mean the general slogan for most police departments is “To protect and defend.” I mean it’s their job to get out there, now they—
Paul Helmke (role: against): His argument is that you can’t sue them if they haven’t responded
Paul Helmke (role: against): And let me address that argument, it’s Steve’s argument, at some extent, is true.
Paul Helmke (role: against): The Supreme Court made that very clear in the Heller case, you know, I do wonder a little bit about Justice Roberts’s comments that he wasn’t, you know, he wanted to be able to shoot his gun but he needed to turn on the light and put on his reading glasses before that, and that’s the example Steve just gave and I thought gee, if the Chief Justice needs to put on his glasses and turn the light on before he can shoot maybe, he shouldn’t be shooting, but— It gets into the issue of, yes, people do have a—
Paul Helmke (role: against): But what we do when we live in communities is we set up police departments because they’re the individuals that are trained, they’re the individuals that respond.
Paul Helmke (role: against): Homes with more guns have more gun violence, cities with more guns have more gun violence, states with more guns, countries with more guns, more gun violence, now that includes gun suicides and gun accidents, not just gun homicides.
Paul Helmke (role: against): 20 percent of the time that an officer’s shot it’s his gun or his partner’s, so you’ve gotta expand that to the partner’s gun.

Stephen Halbrook (role: for): The—
John Donvan (role: mod): Wait, let Stephen answer that, that was a question to Stephen.
Stephen Halbrook (role: for): We did not argue that machine guns were protected by the Second Amendment, we argued that, a constitutional issue was raised by whether they should be banned or not and it’s something that— It had to do with a statutory interpretation, it’s not a case that was a Second Amendment case—the only Second Amendment case the Supreme Court has dealt with is the Heller case, and it’s decided that the kind of guns that we’re all ordinarily talking about here, rifles, pistols and handguns are the ones that are, I’m sorry, rifles, shotguns and handguns are the ones that are constitutionally protected— these other issues are red herrings.
Gary Kleck (role: for): I think it’s kind of ironic here that we hear an echo of the NRA’s old slippery slope argument, you know, that if they have even moderate control it’ll eventually lead to prohibition, this is kind of the flip-side of that.

Gil Kerlikowske (role: against): On the issue of gun buy-backs I think the research is pretty clear, does it deter crime, does it result in guns being taken off the street that are crime guns… A lot of times they’re old guns, they’re guns that are not being used in crimes and they’re being found by people cleaning out garages, et cetera.
R. Gil Kerlikowske (role: against): But I don’t think we see it as a huge issue as far as reducing crime.
John R. Lott (role: for): On the gun buy-back issue, I don’t know of one single academic study by any type of academic, that finds that they reduce any type of violent crime rate.
John R. Lott (role: for): And it’s easy to check.
John R. Lott (role: for): The type of incident that there was, this wounding, is the only case I know like that in the state of Washington, nobody has been convicted of murder for example in Washington that’s had a concealed-carry permit, and you’re talking about almost 50 years.
John R. Lott (role: for): In Florida, you can go to the website for the department that issues permits, and they have detailed data there, you find that, from October 1987 through September 31st of this year, they had issued over 1.41 million permits to 1.41 million people.

Paul Helmke (role: against): In other states it actually goes to the Chief of Police or to the Sheriff, who does a check to see whether you—not only is your record clean but, in terms of the felony conviction, but they check to see are the police responding to your house every week because of domestic quarrels, is this a kid that you’ve had to arrest a number of times on minor things that aren’t going to be a disqualifier.
Paul Helmke (role: against): It was questionable whether he should’ve been acquitted, it was one of those cases.

R. Gil Kerlikowske (role: against): On the issue of gun buy-backs I think the research is pretty clear, does it deter crime, does it result in guns being taken off the street that are crime guns… A lot of times they’re old guns, they’re guns that are not being used in crimes and they’re being found by people cleaning out garages, et cetera.
R. Gil Kerlikowske (role: against): But I don’t think we see it as a huge issue as far as reducing crime.
John R. Lott (role: for): On the gun buy-back issue, I don’t know of one single academic study by any type of academic, that finds that they reduce any type of violent crime rate.
John R. Lott (role: for): And it’s easy to check.
John R. Lott (role: for): The type of incident that there was, this wounding, is the only case I know like that in the state of Washington, nobody has been convicted of murder for example in Washington that’s had a concealed-carry permit, and you’re talking about almost 50 years.
John R. Lott (role: for): In Florida, you can go to the website for the department that issues permits, and they have detailed data there, you find that, from October 1987 through September 31st of this year, they had issued over 1.41 million permits to 1.41 million people.
John R. Lott (role: for): Virtually all those were for one type of violation, that was someone who accidentally carried a concealed handgun into a gun-free zone like an airport or what have you—
John Donvan (role: mod): This is Paul Helmke
Paul Helmke (role: against): —the Sun-Sentinel, did a study in 2006, before the legislature closed off this website, this is the new move by the way, is that the gun pushers come in and they say we don’t want this information to be public because we don’t want you to know what’s happening with the concealed carry permit holders.
Paul Helmke (role: against): And then—and the Florida legislature, said, we don’t want to make this information public anymore.

John Donvan (role: mod): The mistake was mine alone, but I'm very much reminded of the fact that we are not in Indiana, that we are in New York City, because we have the numbers in.
John Donvan (role: mod): Polling the audience before the debate on the motion, and we’re going to put them up on the screen now, the motion being “Guns Reduce Crime.” Thirteen percent of you supported this motion before the debate, sixty percent of you opposed the motion, and twenty- seven percent were undecided.
John Donvan (role: mod): We’ll be polling you again toward the end of the debate to see whether any minds have been changed.
John Donvan (role: mod): We’re going to begin the section now, where the debaters address one another and also take questions from you, the audience.
John Donvan (role: mod): And again, I would very much encourage any of you who are here to participate.

John Donvan (role: mod): Again, we would encourage you to keep your questions exceedingly short.
John Donvan (role: mod): What you need to do is raise your hand, and we have ushers who are moving around the aisles, and will come to you, and locate you.
John Donvan (role: mod): But I just want to go to John Lott, who, in a sense, your work embodies this motion that guns reduce crime, and your statistical work embodies that motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): And yet tonight I heard some of the fundamental work you’re done referred to as a fantasy.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I heard the question raised by former Mayor Helmke, if guns prevent crime, why isn't this the most safe nation in the world?
John Donvan (role: mod): What is the answer to that, and what about the fantasy issue?
John R. Lott (role: for): Well, I mean, there are lots of academics that have, I’ll just take the fantasy issue first.
John R. Lott (role: for): There are lots of academics who have looked at the relationship between concealed hand gun laws and crime rates, and if you look at papers published in refereed academic journals by economists and criminologists, you’ll find about seventy percent of them find that when right to carry laws get passed, there’s drops in violent crime rates.
John R. Lott (role: for): About thirty percent say there’s no change that’s there.
John R. Lott (role: for): And then there’s not one refereed academic journal that I know of that finds that there’s a bad effect from these.
John R. Lott (role: for): So there’s a lot of people that looked at this in many different ways.
John J. Donohue (role: against): John, John, you're ignoring the National Academy of Science Panel—
John R. Lott (role: for): I'm happy to—
John J. Donohue (role: against): 15 to one, including some of the top econometricians in the country—
John R. Lott (role: for): Right.

John R. Lott (role: for): But the promise—
Gary Kleck (role: for): And the real debate is simply between people who say there is a beneficial effect, versus those who say there’s no effect.
Gary Kleck (role: for): There basically is no, no participation on John’s side, on John Donohue’s side.
Gary Kleck (role: for): Basically there is no support for the view it has counterproductive violence-elevating effects.","{'breakdown': None, 'post': {'undecided': 10.0, 'for': 27.0, 'against': 63.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 27.0, 'for': 13.0, 'against': 60.0}}",John R.

R. Gil Kerlikowske (role: against): But there are very few because of body armor and the changes in body armor in this country, there are very few police officers now killed or wounded in the line of duty, that the number—that the numbers that we used to see.
Gary Kleck (role: for): There were never many—
Gary Kleck (role: for): There were never many even 20 years ago or 30 years ago before the advent of body armor, it was no more true than now, it’s simply untrue—
John R. Lott (role: for): Look, five, it’d be better if it was zero but if you look at the number of police officers who are assaulted in a year you’re talking about between 16 and 20,000.
John R. Lott (role: for): And police officers have a much more difficult job than civilians do, a police officer can’t brandish a gun, watch the criminal run away, and be satisfied that his job’s over with.
John R. Lott (role: for): One of the benefits a civilian has, if you take a right-to-carry class to get your permit someplace, one of the things they’re going to tell you is you’re not the police.
John R. Lott (role: for): The benefit that you have of having a gun, is to maximize the distance between yourself and the criminal.

John R. Lott (role: for): So the ratio—
John R. Lott (role: for): Yeah, you’re talking about at most five a year or so, even in the high years that that is.
John R. Lott (role: for): And so if you’re asking, what’s the rate of a police officer who’s assaulted, who’s going to lose control of his weapon and have it used against him—and going to result in his death, it’s a tiny number, but even more important I think to make is a comparison to civilians, because that’s partly the motivation for this.

Paul Helmke (role: against): His argument is that you can’t sue them if they haven’t responded
Paul Helmke (role: against): And let me address that argument, it’s Steve’s argument, at some extent, is true.
Paul Helmke (role: against): The Supreme Court made that very clear in the Heller case, you know, I do wonder a little bit about Justice Roberts’s comments that he wasn’t, you know, he wanted to be able to shoot his gun but he needed to turn on the light and put on his reading glasses before that, and that’s the example Steve just gave and I thought gee, if the Chief Justice needs to put on his glasses and turn the light on before he can shoot maybe, he shouldn’t be shooting, but— It gets into the issue of, yes, people do have a—
Paul Helmke (role: against): But what we do when we live in communities is we set up police departments because they’re the individuals that are trained, they’re the individuals that respond.
Paul Helmke (role: against): Homes with more guns have more gun violence, cities with more guns have more gun violence, states with more guns, countries with more guns, more gun violence, now that includes gun suicides and gun accidents, not just gun homicides.
Paul Helmke (role: against): 20 percent of the time that an officer’s shot it’s his gun or his partner’s, so you’ve gotta expand that to the partner’s gun.

John R. Lott (role: for): And what…Jim showed, was that if you look at every single one of the National Academy of Sciences estimates on the impact of right-to-carry laws on murder rates, every single one of their own estimates showed that right-to-carry laws reduced murder rates.

Richard Sander<for>: Professor of Law, UCLA School of Law
Randall Kennedy<against>: Professor of Law, Harvard Law School
Theodore Shaw<against>: Professor of Law, Columbia Law School","John Donvan (role: mod): Ted Shaw.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you very much.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes Round 1 of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, where our motion is ""Affirmative Action on Campus Does More Harm Than Good.” Now we move on to Round 2.
John Donvan (role: mod): And in Round 2, the debaters address one another directly, and they take questions from me and you-- from you in our live audience.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have heard arguments from both sides.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now, the side arguing for this motion: Affirmative Action on Campus Does More Harm Than Good, Gail Heriot and Richard Sander.
John Donvan (role: mod): First of all, they told us what they're not arguing.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're not arguing that all forms of affirmative action are not-- are doing more harm than good.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're fine with things like outreach.
John Donvan (role: mod): But it's the mechanism, they say, of racial preferences, that they call ""misbegotten.” They argue that it backfires and hurts those that it is meant to help, that minority students can find themselves boosted into an academic pool in which they're in over their heads, and that they fail-- therefore, that they become discouraged.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that if they fail, it means that racial preferences, as a tool, have failed.
John Donvan (role: mod): Although they say that universities do not want to admit this-- and will not share the data on this.
John Donvan (role: mod): The side arguing against the motion, Randall Kennedy and Theodore Shaw, they did not directly address the argument put forward by the other side, but they're taking another crack at this.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're basically telling you that affirmative action has done more good than harm.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're saying that the case for good comes from not only the impact of affirmative action on a wider student body of the experience of greater diversity, but that, also, in the sense that symbolism of affirmative action, in itself, encourages people who might never have attempted to get into an academic-- high academic setting-- to reach for something they may not have believed in before.
John Donvan (role: mod): They argue that this struggle is not over, that the issues and the deficits-- social and economic deficits that affirmative action were meant to address linger on today.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, those are basically the two arguments in there.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to work through and revisit some of all of this, but work through a little bit, step by step, and take to the side that's arguing against this motion-- since you did not address the main point that your opponents made-- the mechanism by which they say that affirmative action and large-- large preferences-- actually, I'd like to ask you one more time to define what you mean by ""large preferences,"" Gail.
John Donvan (role: mod): You said we would be graduating more engineers and more scientists from minority groups, except that we're not, because we're giving them such a great preference.
John Donvan (role: mod): What is a great preference?
Gail Heriot (role: for): Well, I think the example from the University of Michigan is a good one.
Gail Heriot (role: for): That was an entire letter grade on the GPA-- or alternatively, 300 points on the combined SAT.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, I just want to make sure that we all know what it is we're talking about and what this disagreement is-- might be about on this issue.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, I want to go to the other side-- maybe take it to Randall Kennedy.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, your opponents are arguing that there's this-- there's this dynamic by which a minority student who is not-- who is not as academically prepared-- perhaps as measured by SAT scores or GPA, or this high school of his origin, shows up in a place where he's up against some tough competition, and it kind of breaks him, breaks his spirit.
John Donvan (role: mod): He drops out.
John Donvan (role: mod): He changes out of the sciences.
John Donvan (role: mod): He never graduates whatever it is.
John Donvan (role: mod): That that's a dynamic-- that that you can see the psychological rationale that's being put forward there.
John Donvan (role: mod): I don't know if you want to take that on, or the numbers, or what, but if you could respond do it.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Sure.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): I'd be happy to respond.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): And there are a couple of responses.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): First, my adversaries make reference to studies that posit the mismatch thesis, which has been posited for a long time.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Maybe there's something to it.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): In fact, I think in some instances, there are.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): We should not accept this, however, as an uncontroversial proposition.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): The fact of the matter is that there are people who have studied the same phenomena that disagree very much with Professor Sander and others who have made the sort of claims that you've heard.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): You've heard the claim, for instance, that affirmative action actually decreases the numbers of black lawyers.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): There are other people who have studied the data and have come to a very different conclusion.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): So, the empirical situation is itself-- you know, it's controversial.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): It's not clearcut.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Furthermore, I'm willing to stipulate, for the sake of argument--I'm willing to stipulate that what they say is true.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): So let's stipulate that.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): I'll give them that.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Then the question becomes, what of it?
Randall Kennedy (role: against): My opponents have a certain strange solicitude.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): They want to save the-- they want to save African American and Latino students from getting the invitation to selective institutions.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): No one is forcing anyone to attend these institutions.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): If they don't want to go, they don't have to go.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): So-- but I think that there are-- but why would we not allow people the opportunity to advance themselves if they, you know, so desire and if these institutions believe that it is in their interest, their institutional interests, to invite these students to come?
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me take that to-- who would like to take that?
Richard Sander (role: for): I'll take it.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay, Rick Sander.
Richard Sander (role: for): So we may be able to resolve this debate and just come to agreement.
Richard Sander (role: for): I will agree with Randall that I withdraw all my objections to affirmative action if colleges and universities will adopt the following practice: When they accept someone for admission, they also provide a detailed statement of how that student's credentials predict their performance.
Richard Sander (role: for): If they're an engineering applicant, tell them the chances, tell them the past record of students with identical credentials who have actually achieved an engineering degree at that school.
Richard Sander (role: for): If they want to go to law school, tell them, what are the chances that a student with their credentials has passed the bar on the first attempt and what their GPA has been on average.
Richard Sander (role: for): If that information is provided, then you're right, all that affirmative action is doing is increasing the range of opportunities.
Richard Sander (role: for): What's wrong with that?
Richard Sander (role: for): The problem is the schools don't do that.
Richard Sander (role: for): They do not provide transparent.
Richard Sander (role: for): They actually actively counter measure.
Richard Sander (role: for): They actively conceal.
Richard Sander (role: for): They won't disclose data on what they're doing.
Richard Sander (role: for): They tell students that everyone has the same chance of success.
Richard Sander (role: for): Everyone is equally qualified and will have the same outcomes.
Richard Sander (role: for): These things are manifestly not true.
Richard Sander (role: for): So students are accepting offers based on dramatic information-- misinformation.
John Donvan (role: mod): Bring it to--
Richard Sander (role: for): And you don't have to take my word for it.
Richard Sander (role: for): There was actually a study done at Duke where a professor looked at the information that the university had internally and went to students and said, okay, if you have this information, what would your enrollment decision be?
Richard Sander (role: for): And they made different decisions.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 7.0, 'undecided_for': 14.0, 'for_against': 5.0, 'for_for': 16.0, 'undecided_against': 10.0, 'for_undecided': 1.0, 'undecided_undecided': 6.0, 'against_undecided': 3.0, 'against_against': 38.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 9.0, 'for': 36.0, 'against': 55.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 30.0, 'for': 22.0, 'against': 48.0}}",John Donvan,mod,Ted Shaw.

Theodore Shaw (role: against): But even if we acknowledge, as we must, that there is a gap between performance on standardized tests, does that acknowledgment then lead us inevitably to the answer that affirmative action is doing more harm on campus than good?

John Donvan (role: mod): So, I just want to make sure that we all know what it is we're talking about and what this disagreement is-- might be about on this issue.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
Gail Heriot (role: for): That was an entire letter grade on the GPA-- or alternatively, 300 points on the combined SAT.
Gail Heriot (role: for): Well, I think the example from the University of Michigan is a good one.
John Donvan (role: mod): What is a great preference?
John Donvan (role: mod): You said we would be graduating more engineers and more scientists from minority groups, except that we're not, because we're giving them such a great preference.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to work through and revisit some of all of this, but work through a little bit, step by step, and take to the side that's arguing against this motion-- since you did not address the main point that your opponents made-- the mechanism by which they say that affirmative action and large-- large preferences-- actually, I'd like to ask you one more time to define what you mean by ""large preferences,"" Gail.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, those are basically the two arguments in there.
John Donvan (role: mod): They argue that this struggle is not over, that the issues and the deficits-- social and economic deficits that affirmative action were meant to address linger on today.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're saying that the case for good comes from not only the impact of affirmative action on a wider student body of the experience of greater diversity, but that, also, in the sense that symbolism of affirmative action, in itself, encourages people who might never have attempted to get into an academic-- high academic setting-- to reach for something they may not have believed in before.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're basically telling you that affirmative action has done more good than harm.
John Donvan (role: mod): The side arguing against the motion, Randall Kennedy and Theodore Shaw, they did not directly address the argument put forward by the other side, but they're taking another crack at this.
John Donvan (role: mod): Although they say that universities do not want to admit this-- and will not share the data on this.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that if they fail, it means that racial preferences, as a tool, have failed.
John Donvan (role: mod): But it's the mechanism, they say, of racial preferences, that they call ""misbegotten.” They argue that it backfires and hurts those that it is meant to help, that minority students can find themselves boosted into an academic pool in which they're in over their heads, and that they fail-- therefore, that they become discouraged.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're fine with things like outreach.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're not arguing that all forms of affirmative action are not-- are doing more harm than good.
John Donvan (role: mod): First of all, they told us what they're not arguing.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now, the side arguing for this motion: Affirmative Action on Campus Does More Harm Than Good, Gail Heriot and Richard Sander.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have heard arguments from both sides.
John Donvan (role: mod): And in Round 2, the debaters address one another directly, and they take questions from me and you-- from you in our live audience.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes Round 1 of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, where our motion is ""Affirmative Action on Campus Does More Harm Than Good.” Now we move on to Round 2.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you very much.
John Donvan (role: mod): Ted Shaw.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): Well, first, I invite you all to look at studies that have been done by Richard A. Burke of University of Pennsylvania, David E. Ho of Stanford University, Richard Brooks, later of Yale but now at Columbia Law School, and other studies, many other studies.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): These propositions that our adversaries have articulated today are challenged.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): But even if we acknowledge, as we must, that there is a gap between performance on standardized tests, does that acknowledgment then lead us inevitably to the answer that affirmative action is doing more harm on campus than good?
Theodore Shaw (role: against): We're talking about the integration of campuses.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): And if we want to look to evidence, look to the President of the United States, the attorney general, the CEO of American Express.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): Look to African-Americans, look to Latinos who are graduated within the last couple of generations from selective institutions, including this one.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right.
Gail Heriot (role: for): Well, first of all, no one has ever rebutted the studies that I cited, not anyone.
Gail Heriot (role: for): And again, some of those same scholars are the ones who basically said the database isn't good enough and then tried to prevent him from getting access to the California database.
Gail Heriot (role: for): And, sure, there are plenty of people who have benefited in some way.
Gail Heriot (role: for): I suspect that you and Randall would have been very successful even without preferences, assuming that you got preferences.
Gail Heriot (role: for): One interesting thing is that there's one bit of evidence from--
John Donvan (role: mod): In 1950, these guys would have done as well as they have done in 1980, 1990, 2000?

Randall Kennedy (role: against): So-- but I think that there are-- but why would we not allow people the opportunity to advance themselves if they, you know, so desire and if these institutions believe that it is in their interest, their institutional interests, to invite these students to come?
Randall Kennedy (role: against): If they don't want to go, they don't have to go.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): No one is forcing anyone to attend these institutions.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): They want to save the-- they want to save African American and Latino students from getting the invitation to selective institutions.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): My opponents have a certain strange solicitude.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Then the question becomes, what of it?
Randall Kennedy (role: against): I'll give them that.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): So let's stipulate that.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Furthermore, I'm willing to stipulate, for the sake of argument--I'm willing to stipulate that what they say is true.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): It's not clearcut.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): So, the empirical situation is itself-- you know, it's controversial.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): There are other people who have studied the data and have come to a very different conclusion.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): You've heard the claim, for instance, that affirmative action actually decreases the numbers of black lawyers.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): The fact of the matter is that there are people who have studied the same phenomena that disagree very much with Professor Sander and others who have made the sort of claims that you've heard.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): We should not accept this, however, as an uncontroversial proposition.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): In fact, I think in some instances, there are.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Maybe there's something to it.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): First, my adversaries make reference to studies that posit the mismatch thesis, which has been posited for a long time.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): And there are a couple of responses.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): I'd be happy to respond.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Sure.
John Donvan (role: mod): I don't know if you want to take that on, or the numbers, or what, but if you could respond do it.
John Donvan (role: mod): That that's a dynamic-- that that you can see the psychological rationale that's being put forward there.
John Donvan (role: mod): He never graduates whatever it is.
John Donvan (role: mod): He changes out of the sciences.
John Donvan (role: mod): He drops out.

Gail Heriot (role: for): And, sure, there are plenty of people who have benefited in some way.
Gail Heriot (role: for): I suspect that you and Randall would have been very successful even without preferences, assuming that you got preferences.

John Donvan (role: mod): In 1950, these guys would have done as well as they have done in 1980, 1990, 2000?
Gail Heriot (role: for): They claim to be the beneficiaries of racial preferences.
John Donvan (role: mod): But are you saying that they would have-- I think-- I just want to clarify.
John Donvan (role: mod): I just-- okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
Gail Heriot (role: for): One kind of interesting shred of evidence here-- and I-- it's just a shred, but I find it rather interesting.
Gail Heriot (role: for): And one of the things that she found, she polled, I believe it was, 400 black alumni at Princeton.
Gail Heriot (role: for): She actually found that before Princeton and after Princeton-- that was her comparison-- that black students felt that they were just as comfortable with whites on athletic basis, I believe on several social bases.

Gail Heriot (role: for): If we could-- if we could disclose, and we could do that starting today, and do it honestly, I think that would go a very, very long way to solve the problem because I think students would catch on and they'd do the right thing.

Gail Heriot (role: for): Actually I would be absolutely delighted if we just disclosed, because I think that would do a world of good.
Gail Heriot (role: for): I think that's a much better solution than waiting and having the debate go on for decades here.
Gail Heriot (role: for): So if we could decide on behalf of every law school and every medical school to do that today, then, man, we're in business, and we might as well quit early and go out and have a beer.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): So we have-- we have affirmative action.
Gail Heriot (role: for): I'm satisfied with that debating for 20 years, you know.
Gail Heriot (role: for): But I think actually if you paid attention to the mismatch literature, you're going to get more and more persuaded to our side.
Richard Sander (role: for): So, you know, I mean, it's not a bad thing if we end up agreeing by, you know, 7:00.
John Donvan (role: mod): It's terrible for a debate, though.
Richard Sander (role: for): We're saying that if you fix it, it could work pretty well.
Richard Sander (role: for): So in a way the scope of the agreement, the debate here, is ""What's stupid affirmative action?""
Richard Sander (role: for): I mean, I hear what you're saying, Ted, that racial propositions is a loaded term, right?
Richard Sander (role: for): Excuse me.
Richard Sander (role: for): I mean, that's always been a big theme of affirmative action, that is that women are under the tent as well.
Richard Sander (role: for): I mean, there have been important things in terms of trying to expand the path of access for women.
Richard Sander (role: for): And class has not been a significant subject of preferences, okay?
Richard Sander (role: for): So, one of the reasons that race keeps popping up in the mismatch literature is because that's where the really large preferences are, and that's where the problem seems--
John Donvan (role: mod): Maybe you're right, in terms of the dynamic you're describing in the mismatch-- but that even given that, the good outweighs the harm.
John Donvan (role: mod): But even if that harm that you're describing is real.
John Donvan (role: mod): Why is the harm that you're describing-- that your side has stipulated to-- weigh heavier than that other good?

Randall Kennedy (role: against): --hold it, all people ought to contribute to social missions that are worthwhile.

Richard Sander (role: for): I think we'd like to make--
Richard Sander (role: for): --two short comments.
Richard Sander (role: for): And it's this very narrow focus on race that leads us into this bind because the logical implication of having large racial preferences for blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians is that there should be a large racial penalty for Asian-Americans.
Richard Sander (role: for): And if we focused affirmative action more on pipeline questions, more on ""Who is having difficulty getting access?""
Richard Sander (role: for): And if we were focusing more on individual characteristics, we wouldn't have this bind of treating Asian-Americans the way we used to treat Jewish Americans.
Gail Heriot (role: for): I guess I don't have a whole lot to add--
Gail Heriot (role: for): --a little bit.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): Very quickly on this, I think that this is a thorny and difficult question although I agree with what my colleague, Randy, said about breaking down Asian-Americans as a group.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): One is that nobody, nobody has an absolute right to be admitted to these institutions.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): We're choosing among people who are qualified and they have different backgrounds, different qualifications or levels of qualifications.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): Secondly, I point to what Bok and Bowen said in ""The Shape of the River,"" the analogy they gave-- you know, you're in a parking lot, you know, of a big mall during the holiday season and you see the handicapped spot.

John Donvan (role: mod): Rick Sander, do you want to respond, or would you like to move to another question?
Richard Sander (role: for): I mean, I published my initial study.
Richard Sander (role: for): My analytical abilities were probably limited.
Richard Sander (role: for): But none of these were published in peer-reviewed journals.
Richard Sander (role: for): If you look at the - - sorry, where the dust has settled eight years later, there are now four peer-reviewed studies that have been published that all find strong evidence of law school mismatch.
Richard Sander (role: for): There have been zero studies, zero peer-reviewed studies published on the other side.
Richard Sander (role: for): So if you look closely at this, you see a pretty overwhelming pattern.
Richard Sander (role: for): But when those studies are examined, they're generally focusing on secondary outcomes like graduation rates.
Richard Sander (role: for): Graduation rates, for example, are more manipulable by university policies.
Richard Sander (role: for): So if you look at some secondary outcomes, I think the debate is more mixed, but it really is overwhelming how on the literature of primary mismatch effects, it's essentially undisputed.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): First, you know, the proposition was affirmative action on campus does more harm than good, 99 percent of the discussion has been about racial affirmative action.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Women have certainly-- including white women, have been beneficiaries of affirmative action.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): I would like very much to take Professor Sander up on his comment about how he would withdraw his objections if more information was presented about, you know, what happens with a student with this background getting into the school.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Now, in taking you up on that, which you have implicitly said I take it, is that actually with more information you are fine with affirmative action.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Audience, I want you to be very attentive-- I want you to be very attentive to the disjunction within the side of my adversaries, because one speaker is totally against affirmative action and speaks in terms of laissez-faire, you know, ""Let the chips fall where they may--"" of course, we know where the chips will fall-- that is one speaker, that seems to be Gail's position--
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Gail's position-- Gail's position seems to be, ""Let the chips fall where they may.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): His is more of, ""Well, there's too much affirmative action.” His is a tweaking position.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me stop you because Gail objects to your characterization of her position.
Gail Heriot (role: for): I would be very happy.
Gail Heriot (role: for): If we could-- if we could disclose, and we could do that starting today, and do it honestly, I think that would go a very, very long way to solve the problem because I think students would catch on and they'd do the right thing.

Randall Kennedy (role: against): If they don't want to go, they don't have to go.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): No one is forcing anyone to attend these institutions.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): They want to save the-- they want to save African American and Latino students from getting the invitation to selective institutions.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): My opponents have a certain strange solicitude.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Then the question becomes, what of it?
Randall Kennedy (role: against): I'll give them that.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): So let's stipulate that.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Furthermore, I'm willing to stipulate, for the sake of argument--I'm willing to stipulate that what they say is true.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): It's not clearcut.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): So, the empirical situation is itself-- you know, it's controversial.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): There are other people who have studied the data and have come to a very different conclusion.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): You've heard the claim, for instance, that affirmative action actually decreases the numbers of black lawyers.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): The fact of the matter is that there are people who have studied the same phenomena that disagree very much with Professor Sander and others who have made the sort of claims that you've heard.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): We should not accept this, however, as an uncontroversial proposition.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): In fact, I think in some instances, there are.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Maybe there's something to it.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): First, my adversaries make reference to studies that posit the mismatch thesis, which has been posited for a long time.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): And there are a couple of responses.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): I'd be happy to respond.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Sure.
John Donvan (role: mod): I don't know if you want to take that on, or the numbers, or what, but if you could respond do it.
John Donvan (role: mod): That that's a dynamic-- that that you can see the psychological rationale that's being put forward there.
John Donvan (role: mod): He never graduates whatever it is.
John Donvan (role: mod): He changes out of the sciences.
John Donvan (role: mod): He drops out.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, your opponents are arguing that there's this-- there's this dynamic by which a minority student who is not-- who is not as academically prepared-- perhaps as measured by SAT scores or GPA, or this high school of his origin, shows up in a place where he's up against some tough competition, and it kind of breaks him, breaks his spirit.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, I want to go to the other side-- maybe take it to Randall Kennedy.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, I just want to make sure that we all know what it is we're talking about and what this disagreement is-- might be about on this issue.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
Gail Heriot (role: for): That was an entire letter grade on the GPA-- or alternatively, 300 points on the combined SAT.
Gail Heriot (role: for): Well, I think the example from the University of Michigan is a good one.
John Donvan (role: mod): What is a great preference?
John Donvan (role: mod): You said we would be graduating more engineers and more scientists from minority groups, except that we're not, because we're giving them such a great preference.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to work through and revisit some of all of this, but work through a little bit, step by step, and take to the side that's arguing against this motion-- since you did not address the main point that your opponents made-- the mechanism by which they say that affirmative action and large-- large preferences-- actually, I'd like to ask you one more time to define what you mean by ""large preferences,"" Gail.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, those are basically the two arguments in there.
John Donvan (role: mod): They argue that this struggle is not over, that the issues and the deficits-- social and economic deficits that affirmative action were meant to address linger on today.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're saying that the case for good comes from not only the impact of affirmative action on a wider student body of the experience of greater diversity, but that, also, in the sense that symbolism of affirmative action, in itself, encourages people who might never have attempted to get into an academic-- high academic setting-- to reach for something they may not have believed in before.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're basically telling you that affirmative action has done more good than harm.
John Donvan (role: mod): The side arguing against the motion, Randall Kennedy and Theodore Shaw, they did not directly address the argument put forward by the other side, but they're taking another crack at this.
John Donvan (role: mod): Although they say that universities do not want to admit this-- and will not share the data on this.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that if they fail, it means that racial preferences, as a tool, have failed.
John Donvan (role: mod): But it's the mechanism, they say, of racial preferences, that they call ""misbegotten.” They argue that it backfires and hurts those that it is meant to help, that minority students can find themselves boosted into an academic pool in which they're in over their heads, and that they fail-- therefore, that they become discouraged.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're fine with things like outreach.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're not arguing that all forms of affirmative action are not-- are doing more harm than good.
John Donvan (role: mod): First of all, they told us what they're not arguing.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now, the side arguing for this motion: Affirmative Action on Campus Does More Harm Than Good, Gail Heriot and Richard Sander.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have heard arguments from both sides.
John Donvan (role: mod): And in Round 2, the debaters address one another directly, and they take questions from me and you-- from you in our live audience.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes Round 1 of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, where our motion is ""Affirmative Action on Campus Does More Harm Than Good.” Now we move on to Round 2.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you very much.
John Donvan (role: mod): Ted Shaw.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): Well, first, I invite you all to look at studies that have been done by Richard A. Burke of University of Pennsylvania, David E. Ho of Stanford University, Richard Brooks, later of Yale but now at Columbia Law School, and other studies, many other studies.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): These propositions that our adversaries have articulated today are challenged.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): But even if we acknowledge, as we must, that there is a gap between performance on standardized tests, does that acknowledgment then lead us inevitably to the answer that affirmative action is doing more harm on campus than good?
Theodore Shaw (role: against): We're talking about the integration of campuses.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): And if we want to look to evidence, look to the President of the United States, the attorney general, the CEO of American Express.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): Look to African-Americans, look to Latinos who are graduated within the last couple of generations from selective institutions, including this one.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right.
Gail Heriot (role: for): Well, first of all, no one has ever rebutted the studies that I cited, not anyone.
Gail Heriot (role: for): And again, some of those same scholars are the ones who basically said the database isn't good enough and then tried to prevent him from getting access to the California database.
Gail Heriot (role: for): And, sure, there are plenty of people who have benefited in some way.
Gail Heriot (role: for): I suspect that you and Randall would have been very successful even without preferences, assuming that you got preferences.
Gail Heriot (role: for): One interesting thing is that there's one bit of evidence from--
John Donvan (role: mod): In 1950, these guys would have done as well as they have done in 1980, 1990, 2000?
Gail Heriot (role: for): They claim to be the beneficiaries of racial preferences.

Randall Kennedy<against>: Professor of Law, Harvard Law School
Theodore Shaw<against>: Professor of Law, Columbia Law School","Richard Sander (role: for): So we may be able to resolve this debate and just come to agreement.
Richard Sander (role: for): I will agree with Randall that I withdraw all my objections to affirmative action if colleges and universities will adopt the following practice: When they accept someone for admission, they also provide a detailed statement of how that student's credentials predict their performance.
Richard Sander (role: for): If they're an engineering applicant, tell them the chances, tell them the past record of students with identical credentials who have actually achieved an engineering degree at that school.
Richard Sander (role: for): If they want to go to law school, tell them, what are the chances that a student with their credentials has passed the bar on the first attempt and what their GPA has been on average.
Richard Sander (role: for): If that information is provided, then you're right, all that affirmative action is doing is increasing the range of opportunities.
Richard Sander (role: for): What's wrong with that?
Richard Sander (role: for): The problem is the schools don't do that.
Richard Sander (role: for): They do not provide transparent.
Richard Sander (role: for): They actually actively counter measure.
Richard Sander (role: for): They actively conceal.
Richard Sander (role: for): They won't disclose data on what they're doing.
Richard Sander (role: for): They tell students that everyone has the same chance of success.
Richard Sander (role: for): Everyone is equally qualified and will have the same outcomes.
Richard Sander (role: for): These things are manifestly not true.
Richard Sander (role: for): So students are accepting offers based on dramatic information-- misinformation.
John Donvan (role: mod): Bring it to--
Richard Sander (role: for): And you don't have to take my word for it.
Richard Sander (role: for): There was actually a study done at Duke where a professor looked at the information that the university had internally and went to students and said, okay, if you have this information, what would your enrollment decision be?
Richard Sander (role: for): And they made different decisions.
John Donvan (role: mod): Ted Shaw.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): Look at Claude Steele's stereotype threadwork.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): They are very much being contested.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): You know, the issue of presence of students of color who have been underrepresented and excluded from these institutions until there were conscious efforts to admit them is much bigger than test scores.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): We're talking about equal opportunity on campuses.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): Look to the two Supreme Court justices who are at-- one African-American, one Latina.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): And there's massive evidence of the success of what we call affirmative action.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's take that point to Gail Heriot.
Gail Heriot (role: for): The only report that's actually been taken on by some of the scholars is Rick's, as I said.
Gail Heriot (role: for): As I said, that really speaks volumes.
Gail Heriot (role: for): I don't know whether any of the people that you listed are among them because I don't know what the counter factual is.
Gail Heriot (role: for): And I don't know that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me just stop you.
John Donvan (role: mod): Is that-- if there were racial preferences in any-- in their lives?
Gail Heriot (role: for): If that's so, it may well be that they--
John Donvan (role: mod): You're saying in the absence of racial preferences that they would have done as well.
Gail Heriot (role: for): Yeah, they may have.

Theodore Shaw<against>: Professor of Law, Columbia Law School","Richard Sander (role: for): Well, I would just say, if you look at the debate on law school mismatch, which, as Gail says, has been the most contested one, it's interesting.
Richard Sander (role: for): The data was limited.
Richard Sander (role: for): There were about 20 critical studies published in response.
Richard Sander (role: for): A debate was joined, new articles came out.
Richard Sander (role: for): They all find roughly the disparity in chances caused by large preferences that I mentioned before.
Richard Sander (role: for): And the most recent critique was actually withdrawn when the author admitted that her results cannot be replicated.
Richard Sander (role: for): Now, I would slightly modify Gail's statement that there are many good studies that say that preferences can have net positive effects.
Richard Sander (role: for): The things that we're talking about with mismatch are things like learning, competition, grades, attrition from a science track and so on, things that are directly related to mismatch.
Richard Sander (role: for): A law school or college can decide they want to get their graduation rate up to 97 percent.
John Donvan (role: mod): Randy Kennedy.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Of course, affirmative action's broader than that.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): It's interesting that that doesn't seem to factor very much into the discussion.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): I take you up on that.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): And, in fact, in your comments you said over and over again, you're not really so much against affirmative action, you're just against excessive affirmative action.
Gail Heriot (role: for): No, I--
Randall Kennedy (role: against): No-- let's not have race be involved at all.” Professor Sander's position seems to be considerably different.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right.
Gail Heriot (role: for): Actually I would be absolutely delighted if we just disclosed, because I think that would do a world of good.
Gail Heriot (role: for): I think that's a much better solution than waiting and having the debate go on for decades here.
Gail Heriot (role: for): So if we could decide on behalf of every law school and every medical school to do that today, then, man, we're in business, and we might as well quit early and go out and have a beer.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): So we have-- we have affirmative action.
Gail Heriot (role: for): I'm satisfied with that debating for 20 years, you know.
Gail Heriot (role: for): But I think actually if you paid attention to the mismatch literature, you're going to get more and more persuaded to our side.
Richard Sander (role: for): So, you know, I mean, it's not a bad thing if we end up agreeing by, you know, 7:00.
John Donvan (role: mod): It's terrible for a debate, though.
Richard Sander (role: for): We're saying that if you fix it, it could work pretty well.
Richard Sander (role: for): So in a way the scope of the agreement, the debate here, is ""What's stupid affirmative action?""
Richard Sander (role: for): I mean, I hear what you're saying, Ted, that racial propositions is a loaded term, right?
Richard Sander (role: for): Excuse me.
Richard Sander (role: for): I mean, that's always been a big theme of affirmative action, that is that women are under the tent as well.

Richard Sander (role: for): I think we'd like to make--
Richard Sander (role: for): --two short comments.
Richard Sander (role: for): And it's this very narrow focus on race that leads us into this bind because the logical implication of having large racial preferences for blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians is that there should be a large racial penalty for Asian-Americans.
Richard Sander (role: for): And if we focused affirmative action more on pipeline questions, more on ""Who is having difficulty getting access?""
Richard Sander (role: for): And if we were focusing more on individual characteristics, we wouldn't have this bind of treating Asian-Americans the way we used to treat Jewish Americans.

Randall Kennedy (role: against): It's interesting that that doesn't seem to factor very much into the discussion.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): I take you up on that.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): And, in fact, in your comments you said over and over again, you're not really so much against affirmative action, you're just against excessive affirmative action.
Gail Heriot (role: for): No, I--
Randall Kennedy (role: against): No-- let's not have race be involved at all.” Professor Sander's position seems to be considerably different.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right.
Gail Heriot (role: for): Actually I would be absolutely delighted if we just disclosed, because I think that would do a world of good.
Gail Heriot (role: for): I think that's a much better solution than waiting and having the debate go on for decades here.
Gail Heriot (role: for): So if we could decide on behalf of every law school and every medical school to do that today, then, man, we're in business, and we might as well quit early and go out and have a beer.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): So we have-- we have affirmative action.
Gail Heriot (role: for): I'm satisfied with that debating for 20 years, you know.
Gail Heriot (role: for): But I think actually if you paid attention to the mismatch literature, you're going to get more and more persuaded to our side.

Richard Sander (role: for): And that goes to this issue about kind of, you know, what do we mean by preferences or what do we mean by affirmative action?
Richard Sander (role: for): And I try not to use-- I think we use a bunch in my remarks-- the preferences received by legacies are much smaller on average than preferences based on race.
Richard Sander (role: for): Preferences received by women are virtually nonexistent.
Richard Sander (role: for): But historically that has been very small.
Richard Sander (role: for): But in terms of actual admissions preferences, that's been a-- it's been, essentially, a trivial phenomenon.
Richard Sander (role: for): The typical college gives something like 20 or 30 times the amount of weight to race as they do to class-- if they consider class at all.
John Donvan (role: mod): But your-- one of your of opponents stipulated that maybe you're right.
John Donvan (role: mod): Their point being that the message that affirmative action sends is so enormous and powerful that not only do universities want to embrace it, regardless of even the fact that you're right.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to ask you, what's wrong with that formulation?
Richard Sander (role: for): Because the pervasive tendency of selective institutions is to grossly go overboard.
Richard Sander (role: for): It's, how do I have enough cosmetic diversity in my entering freshman class so that I'm not going to get hassled?
Richard Sander (role: for): And that is totally the wrong question.
Richard Sander (role: for): And so, because we're in this mindset where we're asking the wrong questions, or setting it up to do things that it's not well-engineered to do, we end up getting preferences that are whatever are needed to achieve those cosmetic goals.
John Donvan (role: mod): In the overall scale of things, the--
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
Richard Sander (role: for): preferences of professional schools-- or at the top 200 select schools.
John Donvan (role: mod): The reason I ask you is that to some degree, both sides have been slicing the salami here, but I want to put the salami together.

Theodore Shaw (role: against): Use that term, the debate is over.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): I am, unapologetically, the light of opportunity did not shine in neighborhoods like the one I came from, in areas like the area I came from until people consciously took action to do it.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): And it doesn't mean that I or people like me are not qualified.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): I don't-- I don't accept that.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): But the fact is that what that does is obscure the structural inequality that has existed in our country and that's built into our country.
John Donvan (role: mod): Rick Sander, do you want to respond, or would you like to move to another question?
Richard Sander (role: for): I mean, I published my initial study.
Richard Sander (role: for): My analytical abilities were probably limited.
Richard Sander (role: for): But none of these were published in peer-reviewed journals.
Richard Sander (role: for): If you look at the - - sorry, where the dust has settled eight years later, there are now four peer-reviewed studies that have been published that all find strong evidence of law school mismatch.
Richard Sander (role: for): There have been zero studies, zero peer-reviewed studies published on the other side.
Richard Sander (role: for): So if you look closely at this, you see a pretty overwhelming pattern.
Richard Sander (role: for): But when those studies are examined, they're generally focusing on secondary outcomes like graduation rates.
Richard Sander (role: for): Graduation rates, for example, are more manipulable by university policies.
Richard Sander (role: for): So if you look at some secondary outcomes, I think the debate is more mixed, but it really is overwhelming how on the literature of primary mismatch effects, it's essentially undisputed.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): First, you know, the proposition was affirmative action on campus does more harm than good, 99 percent of the discussion has been about racial affirmative action.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Women have certainly-- including white women, have been beneficiaries of affirmative action.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): I would like very much to take Professor Sander up on his comment about how he would withdraw his objections if more information was presented about, you know, what happens with a student with this background getting into the school.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Now, in taking you up on that, which you have implicitly said I take it, is that actually with more information you are fine with affirmative action.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Audience, I want you to be very attentive-- I want you to be very attentive to the disjunction within the side of my adversaries, because one speaker is totally against affirmative action and speaks in terms of laissez-faire, you know, ""Let the chips fall where they may--"" of course, we know where the chips will fall-- that is one speaker, that seems to be Gail's position--
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Gail's position-- Gail's position seems to be, ""Let the chips fall where they may.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): His is more of, ""Well, there's too much affirmative action.” His is a tweaking position.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me stop you because Gail objects to your characterization of her position.
Gail Heriot (role: for): I would be very happy.
Gail Heriot (role: for): If we could-- if we could disclose, and we could do that starting today, and do it honestly, I think that would go a very, very long way to solve the problem because I think students would catch on and they'd do the right thing.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Great.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): You find that affirmative action just more disclosure?

Theodore Shaw<against>: Professor of Law, Columbia Law School","John Donvan (role: mod): Bring it to--
Richard Sander (role: for): So students are accepting offers based on dramatic information-- misinformation.
Richard Sander (role: for): These things are manifestly not true.
Richard Sander (role: for): Everyone is equally qualified and will have the same outcomes.
Richard Sander (role: for): They tell students that everyone has the same chance of success.
Richard Sander (role: for): They won't disclose data on what they're doing.
Richard Sander (role: for): They actively conceal.
Richard Sander (role: for): They actually actively counter measure.
Richard Sander (role: for): They do not provide transparent.
Richard Sander (role: for): The problem is the schools don't do that.
Richard Sander (role: for): What's wrong with that?
Richard Sander (role: for): If that information is provided, then you're right, all that affirmative action is doing is increasing the range of opportunities.
Richard Sander (role: for): If they want to go to law school, tell them, what are the chances that a student with their credentials has passed the bar on the first attempt and what their GPA has been on average.
Richard Sander (role: for): If they're an engineering applicant, tell them the chances, tell them the past record of students with identical credentials who have actually achieved an engineering degree at that school.
Richard Sander (role: for): I will agree with Randall that I withdraw all my objections to affirmative action if colleges and universities will adopt the following practice: When they accept someone for admission, they also provide a detailed statement of how that student's credentials predict their performance.
Richard Sander (role: for): So we may be able to resolve this debate and just come to agreement.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay, Rick Sander.
Richard Sander (role: for): I'll take it.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me take that to-- who would like to take that?
Randall Kennedy (role: against): So-- but I think that there are-- but why would we not allow people the opportunity to advance themselves if they, you know, so desire and if these institutions believe that it is in their interest, their institutional interests, to invite these students to come?
Randall Kennedy (role: against): If they don't want to go, they don't have to go.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): No one is forcing anyone to attend these institutions.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): They want to save the-- they want to save African American and Latino students from getting the invitation to selective institutions.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): My opponents have a certain strange solicitude.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Then the question becomes, what of it?
Randall Kennedy (role: against): I'll give them that.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): So let's stipulate that.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Furthermore, I'm willing to stipulate, for the sake of argument--I'm willing to stipulate that what they say is true.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): It's not clearcut.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): So, the empirical situation is itself-- you know, it's controversial.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): There are other people who have studied the data and have come to a very different conclusion.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): You've heard the claim, for instance, that affirmative action actually decreases the numbers of black lawyers.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): The fact of the matter is that there are people who have studied the same phenomena that disagree very much with Professor Sander and others who have made the sort of claims that you've heard.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): We should not accept this, however, as an uncontroversial proposition.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): In fact, I think in some instances, there are.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Maybe there's something to it.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): First, my adversaries make reference to studies that posit the mismatch thesis, which has been posited for a long time.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): And there are a couple of responses.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): I'd be happy to respond.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Sure.
John Donvan (role: mod): I don't know if you want to take that on, or the numbers, or what, but if you could respond do it.
John Donvan (role: mod): That that's a dynamic-- that that you can see the psychological rationale that's being put forward there.
John Donvan (role: mod): He never graduates whatever it is.
John Donvan (role: mod): He changes out of the sciences.
John Donvan (role: mod): He drops out.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, your opponents are arguing that there's this-- there's this dynamic by which a minority student who is not-- who is not as academically prepared-- perhaps as measured by SAT scores or GPA, or this high school of his origin, shows up in a place where he's up against some tough competition, and it kind of breaks him, breaks his spirit.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, I want to go to the other side-- maybe take it to Randall Kennedy.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, I just want to make sure that we all know what it is we're talking about and what this disagreement is-- might be about on this issue.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
Gail Heriot (role: for): That was an entire letter grade on the GPA-- or alternatively, 300 points on the combined SAT.
Gail Heriot (role: for): Well, I think the example from the University of Michigan is a good one.
John Donvan (role: mod): What is a great preference?
John Donvan (role: mod): You said we would be graduating more engineers and more scientists from minority groups, except that we're not, because we're giving them such a great preference.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to work through and revisit some of all of this, but work through a little bit, step by step, and take to the side that's arguing against this motion-- since you did not address the main point that your opponents made-- the mechanism by which they say that affirmative action and large-- large preferences-- actually, I'd like to ask you one more time to define what you mean by ""large preferences,"" Gail.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, those are basically the two arguments in there.
John Donvan (role: mod): They argue that this struggle is not over, that the issues and the deficits-- social and economic deficits that affirmative action were meant to address linger on today.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're saying that the case for good comes from not only the impact of affirmative action on a wider student body of the experience of greater diversity, but that, also, in the sense that symbolism of affirmative action, in itself, encourages people who might never have attempted to get into an academic-- high academic setting-- to reach for something they may not have believed in before.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're basically telling you that affirmative action has done more good than harm.
John Donvan (role: mod): The side arguing against the motion, Randall Kennedy and Theodore Shaw, they did not directly address the argument put forward by the other side, but they're taking another crack at this.
John Donvan (role: mod): Although they say that universities do not want to admit this-- and will not share the data on this.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that if they fail, it means that racial preferences, as a tool, have failed.
John Donvan (role: mod): But it's the mechanism, they say, of racial preferences, that they call ""misbegotten.” They argue that it backfires and hurts those that it is meant to help, that minority students can find themselves boosted into an academic pool in which they're in over their heads, and that they fail-- therefore, that they become discouraged.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're fine with things like outreach.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're not arguing that all forms of affirmative action are not-- are doing more harm than good.
John Donvan (role: mod): First of all, they told us what they're not arguing.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now, the side arguing for this motion: Affirmative Action on Campus Does More Harm Than Good, Gail Heriot and Richard Sander.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have heard arguments from both sides.
John Donvan (role: mod): And in Round 2, the debaters address one another directly, and they take questions from me and you-- from you in our live audience.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes Round 1 of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, where our motion is ""Affirmative Action on Campus Does More Harm Than Good.” Now we move on to Round 2.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you very much.
John Donvan (role: mod): Ted Shaw.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): Well, first, I invite you all to look at studies that have been done by Richard A. Burke of University of Pennsylvania, David E. Ho of Stanford University, Richard Brooks, later of Yale but now at Columbia Law School, and other studies, many other studies.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): These propositions that our adversaries have articulated today are challenged.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): But even if we acknowledge, as we must, that there is a gap between performance on standardized tests, does that acknowledgment then lead us inevitably to the answer that affirmative action is doing more harm on campus than good?
Theodore Shaw (role: against): We're talking about the integration of campuses.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): And if we want to look to evidence, look to the President of the United States, the attorney general, the CEO of American Express.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): Look to African-Americans, look to Latinos who are graduated within the last couple of generations from selective institutions, including this one.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right.

Theodore Shaw<against>: Professor of Law, Columbia Law School","Richard Sander (role: for): We're arguing that affirmative action does more harm than good, not that it has to do more harm than good.
Richard Sander (role: for): And you started out basically acknowledging that you're against stupid affirmative action.
Richard Sander (role: for): And that goes to this issue about kind of, you know, what do we mean by preferences or what do we mean by affirmative action?
Richard Sander (role: for): And I try not to use-- I think we use a bunch in my remarks-- the preferences received by legacies are much smaller on average than preferences based on race.
Richard Sander (role: for): Preferences received by women are virtually nonexistent.
Richard Sander (role: for): But historically that has been very small.
Richard Sander (role: for): But in terms of actual admissions preferences, that's been a-- it's been, essentially, a trivial phenomenon.
Richard Sander (role: for): The typical college gives something like 20 or 30 times the amount of weight to race as they do to class-- if they consider class at all.
John Donvan (role: mod): But your-- one of your of opponents stipulated that maybe you're right.
John Donvan (role: mod): Their point being that the message that affirmative action sends is so enormous and powerful that not only do universities want to embrace it, regardless of even the fact that you're right.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to ask you, what's wrong with that formulation?
Richard Sander (role: for): Because the pervasive tendency of selective institutions is to grossly go overboard.
Richard Sander (role: for): It's, how do I have enough cosmetic diversity in my entering freshman class so that I'm not going to get hassled?
Richard Sander (role: for): And that is totally the wrong question.
Richard Sander (role: for): And so, because we're in this mindset where we're asking the wrong questions, or setting it up to do things that it's not well-engineered to do, we end up getting preferences that are whatever are needed to achieve those cosmetic goals.
John Donvan (role: mod): In the overall scale of things, the--
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
Richard Sander (role: for): preferences of professional schools-- or at the top 200 select schools.
John Donvan (role: mod): The reason I ask you is that to some degree, both sides have been slicing the salami here, but I want to put the salami together.

John Donvan (role: mod): I-- I got to go to the other speakers--
John Donvan (role: mod): Ted Shaw.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): I mean, I thought I heard you say that you got me-- and you didn't use the term ""preference"" very much.
Richard Sander (role: for): Racial preference, right.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): Okay.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): We're talking about percentages of maybe three, four, five, low single digits in many of the institutions.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): It's a lot of fuss, given how few African Americans exist at these institutions.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): And if-- I mean, I find it strange that your study focuses on-- I mean, there's a point to be made, I suppose, but I'm not sure where it takes us.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): So what?
Theodore Shaw (role: against): You may say that black students may change at a higher rate of minority students, but that's not the end of the world.

Theodore Shaw (role: against): These propositions that our adversaries have articulated today are challenged.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): But even if we acknowledge, as we must, that there is a gap between performance on standardized tests, does that acknowledgment then lead us inevitably to the answer that affirmative action is doing more harm on campus than good?
Theodore Shaw (role: against): We're talking about the integration of campuses.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): And if we want to look to evidence, look to the President of the United States, the attorney general, the CEO of American Express.

John Donvan (role: mod): Rick Sander, do you want to respond, or would you like to move to another question?
Richard Sander (role: for): I mean, I published my initial study.
Richard Sander (role: for): My analytical abilities were probably limited.
Richard Sander (role: for): But none of these were published in peer-reviewed journals.
Richard Sander (role: for): If you look at the - - sorry, where the dust has settled eight years later, there are now four peer-reviewed studies that have been published that all find strong evidence of law school mismatch.
Richard Sander (role: for): There have been zero studies, zero peer-reviewed studies published on the other side.
Richard Sander (role: for): So if you look closely at this, you see a pretty overwhelming pattern.
Richard Sander (role: for): But when those studies are examined, they're generally focusing on secondary outcomes like graduation rates.
Richard Sander (role: for): Graduation rates, for example, are more manipulable by university policies.
Richard Sander (role: for): So if you look at some secondary outcomes, I think the debate is more mixed, but it really is overwhelming how on the literature of primary mismatch effects, it's essentially undisputed.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): First, you know, the proposition was affirmative action on campus does more harm than good, 99 percent of the discussion has been about racial affirmative action.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Women have certainly-- including white women, have been beneficiaries of affirmative action.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): I would like very much to take Professor Sander up on his comment about how he would withdraw his objections if more information was presented about, you know, what happens with a student with this background getting into the school.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Now, in taking you up on that, which you have implicitly said I take it, is that actually with more information you are fine with affirmative action.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Audience, I want you to be very attentive-- I want you to be very attentive to the disjunction within the side of my adversaries, because one speaker is totally against affirmative action and speaks in terms of laissez-faire, you know, ""Let the chips fall where they may--"" of course, we know where the chips will fall-- that is one speaker, that seems to be Gail's position--
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Gail's position-- Gail's position seems to be, ""Let the chips fall where they may.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): His is more of, ""Well, there's too much affirmative action.” His is a tweaking position.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me stop you because Gail objects to your characterization of her position.
Gail Heriot (role: for): I would be very happy.
Gail Heriot (role: for): If we could-- if we could disclose, and we could do that starting today, and do it honestly, I think that would go a very, very long way to solve the problem because I think students would catch on and they'd do the right thing.

John Donvan (role: mod): Is that-- if there were racial preferences in any-- in their lives?
Gail Heriot (role: for): If that's so, it may well be that they--
John Donvan (role: mod): You're saying in the absence of racial preferences that they would have done as well.
Gail Heriot (role: for): Yeah, they may have.
Gail Heriot (role: for): And my point I was making earlier.
Gail Heriot (role: for): First lady Michelle Obama actually did a senior thesis on the issue of how blacks at Princeton integrate into society.
Gail Heriot (role: for): Her response rate was really not-- not very high, so I'm not claiming this is a very scientific report, but it's interesting.
Gail Heriot (role: for): When it came to comfort with-- with whites on an academic basis, they actually became less comfortable after Princeton than what they were before, which was an interesting result.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Go ahead.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): Well, a couple of things, one, Gail, I-- it's a wonderful thing if nobody's ever rebutted you.
Gail Heriot (role: for): Not rebutted me, but the studies, the studies.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): That's a loaded term.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): I claim to be a beneficiary of affirmative action, and I restate that.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): It didn't happen serendipitously.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): So I appreciate you saying I would have made it anyway.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): I mean, I'd like to think that maybe it was true.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): And we still have not rid ourselves of that structural inequality.
Richard Sander (role: for): Well, I would just say, if you look at the debate on law school mismatch, which, as Gail says, has been the most contested one, it's interesting.
Richard Sander (role: for): The data was limited.
Richard Sander (role: for): There were about 20 critical studies published in response.
Richard Sander (role: for): A debate was joined, new articles came out.
Richard Sander (role: for): They all find roughly the disparity in chances caused by large preferences that I mentioned before.
Richard Sander (role: for): And the most recent critique was actually withdrawn when the author admitted that her results cannot be replicated.
Richard Sander (role: for): Now, I would slightly modify Gail's statement that there are many good studies that say that preferences can have net positive effects.
Richard Sander (role: for): The things that we're talking about with mismatch are things like learning, competition, grades, attrition from a science track and so on, things that are directly related to mismatch.
Richard Sander (role: for): A law school or college can decide they want to get their graduation rate up to 97 percent.
John Donvan (role: mod): Randy Kennedy.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Of course, affirmative action's broader than that.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): It's interesting that that doesn't seem to factor very much into the discussion.

John Donvan (role: mod): But are you saying that they would have-- I think-- I just want to clarify.
John Donvan (role: mod): I just-- okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
Gail Heriot (role: for): One kind of interesting shred of evidence here-- and I-- it's just a shred, but I find it rather interesting.
Gail Heriot (role: for): And one of the things that she found, she polled, I believe it was, 400 black alumni at Princeton.
Gail Heriot (role: for): She actually found that before Princeton and after Princeton-- that was her comparison-- that black students felt that they were just as comfortable with whites on athletic basis, I believe on several social bases.
John Donvan (role: mod): Ted Shaw or Randy, if you have-- Randy hasn't had a shot in the bit, so if you'd like to speak, or you can pass all.
John Donvan (role: mod): Ted Shaw.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): That seems to me to be different from what my experience in academia is generally with studies, but I'll check it out.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): More importantly, though, to be clear, I didn't claim to be the beneficiary of preferences.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): Use that term, the debate is over.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): I am, unapologetically, the light of opportunity did not shine in neighborhoods like the one I came from, in areas like the area I came from until people consciously took action to do it.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): And it doesn't mean that I or people like me are not qualified.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): I don't-- I don't accept that.
Theodore Shaw (role: against): But the fact is that what that does is obscure the structural inequality that has existed in our country and that's built into our country.
John Donvan (role: mod): Rick Sander, do you want to respond, or would you like to move to another question?
Richard Sander (role: for): I mean, I published my initial study.
Richard Sander (role: for): My analytical abilities were probably limited.
Richard Sander (role: for): But none of these were published in peer-reviewed journals.
Richard Sander (role: for): If you look at the - - sorry, where the dust has settled eight years later, there are now four peer-reviewed studies that have been published that all find strong evidence of law school mismatch.
Richard Sander (role: for): There have been zero studies, zero peer-reviewed studies published on the other side.
Richard Sander (role: for): So if you look closely at this, you see a pretty overwhelming pattern.
Richard Sander (role: for): But when those studies are examined, they're generally focusing on secondary outcomes like graduation rates.
Richard Sander (role: for): Graduation rates, for example, are more manipulable by university policies.
Richard Sander (role: for): So if you look at some secondary outcomes, I think the debate is more mixed, but it really is overwhelming how on the literature of primary mismatch effects, it's essentially undisputed.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): First, you know, the proposition was affirmative action on campus does more harm than good, 99 percent of the discussion has been about racial affirmative action.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Women have certainly-- including white women, have been beneficiaries of affirmative action.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): I would like very much to take Professor Sander up on his comment about how he would withdraw his objections if more information was presented about, you know, what happens with a student with this background getting into the school.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Now, in taking you up on that, which you have implicitly said I take it, is that actually with more information you are fine with affirmative action.
Randall Kennedy (role: against): Audience, I want you to be very attentive-- I want you to be very attentive to the disjunction within the side of my adversaries, because one speaker is totally against affirmative action and speaks in terms of laissez-faire, you know, ""Let the chips fall where they may--"" of course, we know where the chips will fall-- that is one speaker, that seems to be Gail's position--

David Frakt (role: against): Might we have found that information without using enhanced interrogation methods?

David Frakt (role: against): They talk about plots that were foiled.
David Frakt (role: against): They don't talk about all the blind alleys that they went down.
David Frakt (role: against): They don't talk about all of the lives that were ruined through false confessions that were wrung out of people in coercive interrogations.
David Frakt (role: against): They don't talk about the people that were falsely accused and only years later were released with no apology, no compensation.
David Frakt (role: against): So it's not entirely one sided.
David Frakt (role: against): Yes, sometimes the methods may work.
David Frakt (role: against): But if they're un-American, then we should not be doing them.
Michael Hayden (role: for): If you're going to debate about what constitutes appropriate interrogation methods, invite me back.
Michael Hayden (role: for): I'd be happy to come.
Michael Hayden (role: for): But that's not what this is about.
Michael Hayden (role: for): This is are these or are these not enemy combatants.
Michael Hayden (role: for): And if they are enemy combatants, do I have the right to hold them, consistent with the laws of armed conflict because they are a danger to you.
Michael Hayden (role: for): The Geneva Convention doesn't require me to prove that they're a criminal.
Michael Hayden (role: for): I simply have to have reasonable belief that they're enemy combatants.
John Donvan (role: mod): But General, the implications of-- the implications of that decision actually in practice have to do with the most important and critical information, the rationale for even heeling to your position is to be able to interrogate them using certain methods.
Michael Hayden (role: for): No, no.
Michael Hayden (role: for): The rationale, the primary purpose is to take the enemy combatant off the battlefield.
Michael Hayden (role: for): And if you overcomplicate my taking them off the battlefield by capturing him, you will leave me with one other choice to take him off the battlefield, and that's to kill him.
Michael Hayden (role: for): Now, do you want to create that box?
Michael Hayden (role: for): If the American political process wants to create that box, the people who are left behind in the intelligence service will work in that box.
Michael Hayden (role: for): But that is a far less noble box than continuing the war as we have traditionally fought wars.
Michael Hayden (role: for): I was stunned--
David Frakt (role: against): Could I respond to that, John?

Marc Thiessen (role: for): Well I will tell you something about that, Stephen mentioned American history.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): No, I’m answering his question.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Until the war on terror, not one of them was given habeas corpus rights to petition their detention.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): My mother is here.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): She fought in the Warsaw uprising in Poland against the Nazis.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): And she was taken into a prisoner of war camp in Germany that would make Guantanamo look like the Four Seasons.
David Frakt (role: against): You would be referring to the Geneva Conventions that the Bush administration said did not apply.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Yes.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): You want to give Geneva Convention rights to terrorists.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): But to take the argument to argument.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): She was in an army that carried its weapons openly, that did not target civilians, that wore uniforms or distinctive insignia.
John Donvan (role: mod): It’s not that we don’t trust you, but I want to check all this with your mother.
John Donvan (role: mod): Can you stand up for just a moment?
John Donvan (role: mod): Is it all true, everything he says?
David Frakt (role: against):  It’s ironic that I'm being accused of not understanding war.
David Frakt (role: against): My objection is to the conduct of that war in the way that we have particularly domestically, are operating and, yes, and I have freely acknowledged that we can detain combatants on the battlefield.
David Frakt (role: against): At a minimum, they are entitled-- all persons are entitled to humane treatment.
David Frakt (role: against): But these are the abuses that they would like to get back to.
David Frakt (role: against): Over time history marches forward and human rights are expanded.
John Donvan (role: mod): Actually, I’d like to hear from Michael Hayden.
Michael Hayden (role: for): This is a legal concept.
Michael Hayden (role: for): Domestic criminal law, or the laws of armed conflict?

Marc Thiessen (role: for): The inaugural address of Barack Obama, our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Congressional authorization of use of military force passed by the House of Representatives 420 to 1, Senate 98 to nothing.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Supreme Court of the United States in the Hamdi decision.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): And, my final piece of evidence, Osama bin Laden’s fatwa, which is entitled: “Declaration of War Against the Americans.” What part of war do you not understand?
Marc Thiessen (role: for): The president, the Congress, the Supreme Court and the enemy all think we're at war, and you do not.
Stephen Jones (role: against): I regret to say that I'm old enough to remember what one of the presidents of my own party did in the name of national security in Watergate and when he tried to use the CIA and the FBI in the name of national security.
Stephen Jones (role: against): And I remember the efforts made to assassinate Patrice Lumumba, and Premier Castro, Dr. Castro, and how that backlashed in this country, and I'm sorry.
Stephen Jones (role: against): Now, that information may be subject to different interpretation.
Stephen Jones (role: against): General, your argument is not with me; it's with the Supreme Court, the majority of whom my presidents appointed.
Stephen Jones (role: against): And if we look at our history, those things that we thought were good in a time of war because the national interest compelled it were wrong.
Stephen Jones (role: against): At least their Imperial Navy did.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponents are saying, essentially, and I think they used the word “un-American.” That your position is so at odds with what we value, including, equal protection under the law.
John Donvan (role: mod): Can you respond to that?
John Donvan (role: mod): No no, I want the answer to his question.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Since the Revolutionary War, the United Stateshas held over 5 million enemy combatants.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): The Geneva Convention, which regulates the conduct of war, nowhere in there does it say that you have a right to contest your detention in a war.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): And my mother was a prisoner of war.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): She threw Molotov cocktails at German soldiers.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): And she was not given the right to petition.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Excuse me.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Well this is the point.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Well you don’t even want to give them Geneva Convention rights because you don’t accept that it’s a war.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): My mother followed the laws of war.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Terrorists do none of those things; they violate all of the rules of war, and so you want to get more rights-- if I understand your position you want to get more rights to people who violate the laws of war, than rights to the people like my mother who followed the laws of war never had.
John Donvan (role: mod): Is she here?
John Donvan (role: mod): Is it all true?
John Donvan (role: mod): Are you proud of Marc?
David Frakt (role: against): I have been awarded Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Service Medal, two National Defense Service Medals, I understand that we are at war.
David Frakt (role: against): Where there is a question about whether they’re-- what their status is, then they're entitled to a hearing under the Geneva Conventions.
David Frakt (role: against): And this is what we got away from in the early years of the Bush administration until the Supreme Court over time reigned in these abuses.
David Frakt (role: against): And I think, Marc suggested that we want to broaden and expand rights, and you know actually that's not such a bad thing.
David Frakt (role: against): And sometimes we extend those rights even to people whom we despise.
Michael Hayden (role: for): David, we both served in the Air Force and I commend you for your service but it’s unfair to make that-- again, if you want to talk about what was done in terms of interrogation, again, it’s a separate debate.
Michael Hayden (role: for): Which of the equally valued legal systems do we want to use?
Michael Hayden (role: for): I think we have the right as a nation to use the laws of armed conflict because we were attacked by an opposing armed enemy force.
Michael Hayden (role: for): I don’t think that there is any dispute that we were attacked in New York City and in Washington.
Stephen Jones (role: against): I concede that point, but it’s not the historical accuracy of the initiating incident that’s at issue.","{'breakdown': None, 'post': {'undecided': 6.0, 'for': 39.0, 'against': 55.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 35.0, 'for': 33.0, 'against': 32.0}}",John Donvan,mod,I’d like to go to the audience for your questions now.

Marc Thiessen (role: for): Every investigation into conduct at Guantanamo Bay has found these allegations of widespread abuse are false.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): No, quote, no evidence of torture or inhumane treatment at JCF Guantanamo.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): He said we can confidently state, based upon this investigation, we found nothing that would any way substantiate detainees’ allegations of torture or violent physical abuse at Guantanamo.

David Frakt (role: against): Well, I want to respond to a specific point made by Marc about this reports, investigations into detainee abuse at Guantanamo and the claim that they searched, and they didn't find anything.
David Frakt (role: against): When I was representing Mohammed Jawad, a teenage boy from Afghanistan at Guantanamo, a prosecutor by the name of lieutenant colonel Darrel Vandeveld turned over some discovery materials to me that showed that my then, at that point, 16 or 17- year-old client had been subjected to what was called the frequent flyer sleep deprivation program.
David Frakt (role: against): And during this program, detainees were moved, and in the case of my client, 112 times from cell to cell during a two-week period.
David Frakt (role: against): And so-- but according to the Schmidt-Furlow report, this program had been stopped after a complaint by the FBI, it had been stopped in March of 2004.
David Frakt (role: against): And so I asked Colonel Vandeveld to continue digging, and he found additional records that showed that this program continued for at least another year.
David Frakt (role: against): In fact, we had the person who ran the program.
David Frakt (role: against): The generals knew about it.
David Frakt (role: against): So these investigations were white washes.
David Frakt (role: against): I tried to bring this to the attention of the Department of Defense.
David Frakt (role: against): What did they do?
John Donvan (role: mod): So we have a very basic disagreement about what we think is happening inside the walls of Guantanamo.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): I think that's a shocking thing to say about Admiral Church and those people who are-- you know, people who wore our uniform with honor-- hold on, no, you talked, now let me--
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Okay, let me get a word in here, please.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): This frequent flier program you referred to, where for someone who's moved once every four hours roughly, two to four hours, what do you think these detainees in Guantanamo do all day?
Marc Thiessen (role: for): They're not making a license plates.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): They read the Koran.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): They play soccer.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): This is not torture.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): You may not like it.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): And you have in the case of some of these people who are at Guantanamo, people who are senior al-Qaeda leaders, senior Taliban leaders who have intelligence about the possibility of planned attacks against the United States and they have the responsibility to get them within the rules of law, and they did it.
David Frakt (role: against): And that's because the senior al-Qaeda leaders were locked up in secret CIA ghost prisons in Eastern European countries and in Thailand and places that we were not allowed to know about, that's where the worst abuses went on, but there were plenty of horrific abuses at Guantanamo--","{'breakdown': None, 'post': {'undecided': 6.0, 'for': 39.0, 'against': 55.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 35.0, 'for': 33.0, 'against': 32.0}}",John Donvan,mod,--was the Director of the CIA.

David Frakt (role: against): And as a military attorney, as a judge advocate, certainly I acknowledge that under the laws of war, we do have the power to detain and remove from the battlefield people who are engaged in active conflict.

Stephen Jones (role: against): Well I suppose the problem that I have, Marc, is that I'm old enough to remember when Lyndon Johnson said we were at war with Vietnam and the legacy and the things that were done in the name of the declaration of war which was nonexistent.
Stephen Jones (role: against): I remember what happened in Iran Contra.
Stephen Jones (role: against): The powers of the federal government in the last 50 years destroyed any credibility when we were asked to believe people in power because frequently they know no more than what we can read in the Economist or the New York Times.
Stephen Jones (role: against): But General Hayden talked about when in history have we had habeas for enemy combatants.
Stephen Jones (role: against): And they brought the argument three times that these people are entitled to habeas review.
Stephen Jones (role: against): And there is no greater example of that than the internment of 200,000 Japanese on the West Coast in World War II because we thought our national security required that we round them up, take them out of their homes and put them in detention camp because they had attacked Pearl Harbor.
John Donvan (role: mod): All of which, at least I want to say to the other side, all of which at least go to the issue of violation of core US values that we say define us.

David Frakt (role: against): When I was representing Mohammed Jawad, a teenage boy from Afghanistan at Guantanamo, a prosecutor by the name of lieutenant colonel Darrel Vandeveld turned over some discovery materials to me that showed that my then, at that point, 16 or 17- year-old client had been subjected to what was called the frequent flyer sleep deprivation program.
David Frakt (role: against): And during this program, detainees were moved, and in the case of my client, 112 times from cell to cell during a two-week period.
David Frakt (role: against): And so-- but according to the Schmidt-Furlow report, this program had been stopped after a complaint by the FBI, it had been stopped in March of 2004.
David Frakt (role: against): And so I asked Colonel Vandeveld to continue digging, and he found additional records that showed that this program continued for at least another year.
David Frakt (role: against): In fact, we had the person who ran the program.

Michael Hayden (role: for): I understand the image of Guantanamo.
Michael Hayden (role: for): As David suggested, we took about two-thirds of the prison population out of Guantanamo, not as David suggested, because we thought they were innocent.
Michael Hayden (role: for): I guess if you believe we are at war and that these are enemy combatants, we've got to put them somewhere.
Michael Hayden (role: for): I understand the image issue.
Michael Hayden (role: for): And--
Michael Hayden (role: for): No.
Michael Hayden (role: for): You're the lawyer, and I'm not, all right?
Michael Hayden (role: for): I sat with-- in my last capacity as head of CIA, I had multiple visits from the president of the International Red Cross as we were trying to get closer to some of the things they were suggesting to us.
Michael Hayden (role: for): They did have-- as David knows, they have CSRTs, combatant status review tribunals, which is what happens within the military.
Michael Hayden (role: for): I just don't understand what of this enemy is unlawful.
Michael Hayden (role: for): What does that give them rights that 6 million other prisoners of war we've held as a nation have not had?
Marc Thiessen (role: for): I do want to, because I-- I thank you also for your service, but I think my answer to you is what you say is you should defend the other people in uniform who serve proudly at Guantanamo and keep this country safe.
John Donvan (role: mod): You mean the Iraqis are misinformed.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Every investigation into conduct at Guantanamo Bay has found these allegations of widespread abuse are false.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): No, quote, no evidence of torture or inhumane treatment at JCF Guantanamo.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): He said we can confidently state, based upon this investigation, we found nothing that would any way substantiate detainees’ allegations of torture or violent physical abuse at Guantanamo.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): We are also hearing from the other side that people there are the poor sheep herders and goat herders who have been wrapped up and taken to Guantanamo.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Just last week in Yemen, the Yeminis arrested a Guantanamo alumnus who was joining al-Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): These are dangerous, dangerous people.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): And even the Obama administration's review found 95 percent of the people who are there right now are either leaders or fighters for al-Qaeda and the Taliban.
John Donvan (role: mod): David Frakt, do you want to respond?
David Frakt (role: against): Well, I want to respond to a specific point made by Marc about this reports, investigations into detainee abuse at Guantanamo and the claim that they searched, and they didn't find anything.
David Frakt (role: against): When I was representing Mohammed Jawad, a teenage boy from Afghanistan at Guantanamo, a prosecutor by the name of lieutenant colonel Darrel Vandeveld turned over some discovery materials to me that showed that my then, at that point, 16 or 17- year-old client had been subjected to what was called the frequent flyer sleep deprivation program.
David Frakt (role: against): And during this program, detainees were moved, and in the case of my client, 112 times from cell to cell during a two-week period.
David Frakt (role: against): And so-- but according to the Schmidt-Furlow report, this program had been stopped after a complaint by the FBI, it had been stopped in March of 2004.
David Frakt (role: against): And so I asked Colonel Vandeveld to continue digging, and he found additional records that showed that this program continued for at least another year.
David Frakt (role: against): In fact, we had the person who ran the program.
David Frakt (role: against): The generals knew about it.
David Frakt (role: against): So these investigations were white washes.
David Frakt (role: against): I tried to bring this to the attention of the Department of Defense.
David Frakt (role: against): What did they do?
John Donvan (role: mod): So we have a very basic disagreement about what we think is happening inside the walls of Guantanamo.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): I think that's a shocking thing to say about Admiral Church and those people who are-- you know, people who wore our uniform with honor-- hold on, no, you talked, now let me--
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Okay, let me get a word in here, please.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): This frequent flier program you referred to, where for someone who's moved once every four hours roughly, two to four hours, what do you think these detainees in Guantanamo do all day?

Marc Thiessen (role: for): We are at war.
Stephen Jones (role: against): Well I suppose the problem that I have, Marc, is that I'm old enough to remember when Lyndon Johnson said we were at war with Vietnam and the legacy and the things that were done in the name of the declaration of war which was nonexistent.
Stephen Jones (role: against): I remember what happened in Iran Contra.
Stephen Jones (role: against): The powers of the federal government in the last 50 years destroyed any credibility when we were asked to believe people in power because frequently they know no more than what we can read in the Economist or the New York Times.
Stephen Jones (role: against): But General Hayden talked about when in history have we had habeas for enemy combatants.
Stephen Jones (role: against): And they brought the argument three times that these people are entitled to habeas review.
Stephen Jones (role: against): And there is no greater example of that than the internment of 200,000 Japanese on the West Coast in World War II because we thought our national security required that we round them up, take them out of their homes and put them in detention camp because they had attacked Pearl Harbor.

Marc Thiessen (role: for): Until the war on terror, not one of them was given habeas corpus rights to petition their detention.

Michael Hayden (role: for): I simply have to have reasonable belief that they're enemy combatants.
John Donvan (role: mod): But General, the implications of-- the implications of that decision actually in practice have to do with the most important and critical information, the rationale for even heeling to your position is to be able to interrogate them using certain methods.
Michael Hayden (role: for): No, no.
Michael Hayden (role: for): The rationale, the primary purpose is to take the enemy combatant off the battlefield.
Michael Hayden (role: for): And if you overcomplicate my taking them off the battlefield by capturing him, you will leave me with one other choice to take him off the battlefield, and that's to kill him.

David Frakt (role: against): The problem is that the war has been defined in such amorphous terms that there's a claim of a global battlefield, including the United States, and that anyone who essentially is against America, and mostly we're talking about-- their focus is on Islamic terrorists-- are enemy combatants.
David Frakt (role: against): But really, he's a criminal.
David Frakt (role: against): I reject that.
David Frakt (role: against): So there is a limited group of people that, yes, if it's in an active war in a theater of war that they can be captured and removed from the battlefield.
David Frakt (role: against): We do not screen them well.
David Frakt (role: against): And that's something that's unprecedented in American history.

Marc Thiessen (role: for): But I'd like to enter some documents into evidence, right?
David Frakt (role: against): Objection
David Frakt (role: against): Hearsay
Marc Thiessen (role: for): The inaugural address of Barack Obama, our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Congressional authorization of use of military force passed by the House of Representatives 420 to 1, Senate 98 to nothing.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Supreme Court of the United States in the Hamdi decision.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): And, my final piece of evidence, Osama bin Laden’s fatwa, which is entitled: “Declaration of War Against the Americans.” What part of war do you not understand?
Marc Thiessen (role: for): The president, the Congress, the Supreme Court and the enemy all think we're at war, and you do not.
Stephen Jones (role: against): I regret to say that I'm old enough to remember what one of the presidents of my own party did in the name of national security in Watergate and when he tried to use the CIA and the FBI in the name of national security.
Stephen Jones (role: against): And I remember the efforts made to assassinate Patrice Lumumba, and Premier Castro, Dr. Castro, and how that backlashed in this country, and I'm sorry.
Stephen Jones (role: against): Now, that information may be subject to different interpretation.
Stephen Jones (role: against): General, your argument is not with me; it's with the Supreme Court, the majority of whom my presidents appointed.
Stephen Jones (role: against): And if we look at our history, those things that we thought were good in a time of war because the national interest compelled it were wrong.
Stephen Jones (role: against): At least their Imperial Navy did.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponents are saying, essentially, and I think they used the word “un-American.” That your position is so at odds with what we value, including, equal protection under the law.
John Donvan (role: mod): Can you respond to that?
John Donvan (role: mod): No no, I want the answer to his question.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Since the Revolutionary War, the United Stateshas held over 5 million enemy combatants.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): The Geneva Convention, which regulates the conduct of war, nowhere in there does it say that you have a right to contest your detention in a war.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): And my mother was a prisoner of war.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): She threw Molotov cocktails at German soldiers.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): And she was not given the right to petition.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Excuse me.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Well this is the point.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Well you don’t even want to give them Geneva Convention rights because you don’t accept that it’s a war.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): My mother followed the laws of war.
Marc Thiessen (role: for): Terrorists do none of those things; they violate all of the rules of war, and so you want to get more rights-- if I understand your position you want to get more rights to people who violate the laws of war, than rights to the people like my mother who followed the laws of war never had.

Peter Hitchens<against>: Columnist, Mail on Sunday & Fmr. Moscow Correspondent, Daily Express","John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Robert Blackwill.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes opening statements in this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, where our motion is: Russia is a marginal power.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now we move on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): Round two is where the debaters address one another directly, and they take questions from me and from you in our audience here in New York City.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing for and against the motion, Russia is a marginal power.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing that Russia is a marginal power, Ian Bremmer and Edward Lucas.
John Donvan (role: mod): We've heard them argue that Russia could be a great nation, but it fails to meet that bar, that it has squandered the opportunities that it has innately and that have been given to it since the end of the Cold War.
John Donvan (role: mod): The nation is paranoid.
John Donvan (role: mod): It contributes very little to the solving of great problems in the world; that Russia doesn't really want responsibility in the first place.
John Donvan (role: mod): It doesn't want to play as a responsible member of the international community.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Peter Hitchens and Robert Blackwill, they argue two ways on this one.
John Donvan (role: mod): One of those partners argues that the anti-Russian narrative being heard from their opponents is in itself a sort of nostalgia for the Cold War and a yearning for an enemy.
John Donvan (role: mod): More specifically, though, they argue that trying to define what-- what Russia is in terms of greatness or marginality, issues like friendship are irrelevant, that a nation that has nuclear weapons, a nation that can destroy New York City in half an hour, almost by definition is already not a nation that you can call marginal, even if you can't call it a great nation, necessarily.
John Donvan (role: mod): What I find interesting in what we've heard in the opening statements so far-- and this is rarely happens in our debates-- is that the two sides actually, I think, agree a hundred percent on the basic facts about what is happening in Russia, that it was a powerful nation, less powerful now, that it is led by a sinister tyrant, that its economy is a bit of a mess.
John Donvan (role: mod): Nobody's disagreeing about that.
John Donvan (role: mod): What they're disagreeing about is what these things imply.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I think what we need to do is go through some of the issues that came up and talk about what they imply in terms of greatness or marginality or somewhere in between.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's start with the most obvious: Nuclear weapons.
John Donvan (role: mod): Robert Blackwill, the side arguing against the motion, has said the ability of the Soviet Union to blow us up and perhaps ultimately their intentions to do so, make them highly, highly relevant to the United States and to the rest of the world.
John Donvan (role: mod): He also points out that that may underwrite the fact that Soviet diplomats get attention, they get time in-- sorry, Russian.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you.
John Donvan (role: mod): Did I say Soviet.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): Twice.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's go back and do that whole thing over again.
John Donvan (role: mod): for the record, and for our radio listeners, I lived there during the Soviets, and I can't get it out of my head.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I mean Russian.
John Donvan (role: mod): Every time I've said, ""Soviets"" so far, almost all of those times.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's go to the side, though, that's arguing for it, the motion, Russia is a marginal power, and take on this issue of nuclear capability that Russia still possesses, which your opponents say all by itself makes-- makes it impossible to call Russia a marginal power.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's take that to Ed Lucas.
Edward Lucas (role: for): Well, as I said, almost my opening words, Russia is a nuclear superpower.
Edward Lucas (role: for): It's worth bearing in mind, of course, that having the nuclear war heads is one thing, and delivering them is another.
Edward Lucas (role: for): And the record of the Russian Navy, of building new strategic submarines is pretty-- pretty patchy, even by the lamentable standards of defense procurement contracts worldwide.
Edward Lucas (role: for): And there's something slightly comic about seeing the old bear bombers which look like something out of Dr. Strangelove lumbering up to Guam and other places in NATO air space to try and provoke us and scare us.

Amb. Robert D. Blackwill<against>: Fmr. Deputy National Security Adviser under Pres. George W. Bush
Peter Hitchens<against>: Columnist, Mail on Sunday & Fmr. Moscow Correspondent, Daily Express","Edward Lucas (role: for): I worry about the security of the Soviet-- Russian-- ex-Soviet and now Russian…it’s catching--
Edward Lucas (role: for): And you kind of wonder if the rubber bands and gaffer tape or duct tape is still holding it together all right.
Edward Lucas (role: for): And there's something slightly comic about seeing the old bear bombers which look like something out of Dr. Strangelove lumbering up to Guam and other places in NATO air space to try and provoke us and scare us.
Edward Lucas (role: for): And the record of the Russian Navy, of building new strategic submarines is pretty-- pretty patchy, even by the lamentable standards of defense procurement contracts worldwide.
Edward Lucas (role: for): It's worth bearing in mind, of course, that having the nuclear war heads is one thing, and delivering them is another.
Edward Lucas (role: for): Well, as I said, almost my opening words, Russia is a nuclear superpower.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's take that to Ed Lucas.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's go to the side, though, that's arguing for it, the motion, Russia is a marginal power, and take on this issue of nuclear capability that Russia still possesses, which your opponents say all by itself makes-- makes it impossible to call Russia a marginal power.
John Donvan (role: mod): Every time I've said, ""Soviets"" so far, almost all of those times.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I mean Russian.
John Donvan (role: mod): for the record, and for our radio listeners, I lived there during the Soviets, and I can't get it out of my head.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's go back and do that whole thing over again.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): Twice.
John Donvan (role: mod): Did I say Soviet.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you.
John Donvan (role: mod): He also points out that that may underwrite the fact that Soviet diplomats get attention, they get time in-- sorry, Russian.
John Donvan (role: mod): Robert Blackwill, the side arguing against the motion, has said the ability of the Soviet Union to blow us up and perhaps ultimately their intentions to do so, make them highly, highly relevant to the United States and to the rest of the world.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's start with the most obvious: Nuclear weapons.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I think what we need to do is go through some of the issues that came up and talk about what they imply in terms of greatness or marginality or somewhere in between.
John Donvan (role: mod): What they're disagreeing about is what these things imply.
John Donvan (role: mod): Nobody's disagreeing about that.
John Donvan (role: mod): What I find interesting in what we've heard in the opening statements so far-- and this is rarely happens in our debates-- is that the two sides actually, I think, agree a hundred percent on the basic facts about what is happening in Russia, that it was a powerful nation, less powerful now, that it is led by a sinister tyrant, that its economy is a bit of a mess.
John Donvan (role: mod): More specifically, though, they argue that trying to define what-- what Russia is in terms of greatness or marginality, issues like friendship are irrelevant, that a nation that has nuclear weapons, a nation that can destroy New York City in half an hour, almost by definition is already not a nation that you can call marginal, even if you can't call it a great nation, necessarily.
John Donvan (role: mod): One of those partners argues that the anti-Russian narrative being heard from their opponents is in itself a sort of nostalgia for the Cold War and a yearning for an enemy.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Peter Hitchens and Robert Blackwill, they argue two ways on this one.
John Donvan (role: mod): It doesn't want to play as a responsible member of the international community.
John Donvan (role: mod): It contributes very little to the solving of great problems in the world; that Russia doesn't really want responsibility in the first place.
John Donvan (role: mod): The nation is paranoid.
John Donvan (role: mod): We've heard them argue that Russia could be a great nation, but it fails to meet that bar, that it has squandered the opportunities that it has innately and that have been given to it since the end of the Cold War.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing that Russia is a marginal power, Ian Bremmer and Edward Lucas.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing for and against the motion, Russia is a marginal power.
John Donvan (role: mod): Round two is where the debaters address one another directly, and they take questions from me and from you in our audience here in New York City.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now we move on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes opening statements in this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, where our motion is: Russia is a marginal power.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Robert Blackwill.
John Donvan (role: mod): What pushes Russia from the center of the game?
John Donvan (role: mod): It's how they use them.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): So those are facts.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): They take it seriously.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): And third, Russia has not delivered advanced air defense systems to Iran.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): So all three of those facts are wrong.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): The question again, just to remind ourselves, is not, is Russia a responsible power?
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): And we can list all the different ways.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): It's rather how important a power is it, and the nuclear weapons make it of consequence to the United States.
John Donvan (role: mod): Take that point about why you're, to some degree, hinging your argument on whether Russia is a grownup, mature player in the game.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): I mean, Russia is a nuclear superpower.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): That's nice.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): The fact is, we're not very concerned about their nukes.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): And just last year, finally, we said, well, you know, we've dealt with al-Qaeda at least in terms of the United States, just not for other countries, but now we're much more concerned about cyber as the principal concern for the United States.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): But in terms of the potential of a government to engage in cyber attacks against the U.S., that is head and shoulders, neck, body-- it's China above anybody else, above the Russians.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): What we are going to say is that alone doesn't actually cut it on the world stage today.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): We don't-- our strategic planning as a country and our prioritization and policy is not as if that is the principal thing that we are losing sleep over on a daily basis.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Well, I don't actually share this concern about nuclear weapons very much because I've come to the conclusion that they are more or less unusable, and I don't think anybody would-- since Harry Truman used them, I don't think anybody else will ever do so.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): But--
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Well, I do.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): But I think it is simply the absurdity in this is not about nuclear weapons as the absurdity is in the wishful thinking of those who would like there not to be a major power on the planet which differs from the United States on a number of very important objectives.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): We'd like it to be the case that we could globalize the world and sweep away borders to the extent they have.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): –It has a sort of supreme Soviet with no opposition.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): It is entirely lawless.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): And this is-- This is the body which we were supposedly--
Peter Hitchens (role: against): It has to do with the fact that there was-- what has provoked the immense international crisis in which we now find ourselves is not a struggle between freedom and tyranny.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): And one power block is in favor of globalism and the sweeping away of borders.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 9.0, 'undecided_for': 12.0, 'for_against': 9.0, 'for_for': 14.0, 'undecided_against': 17.0, 'for_undecided': 1.0, 'undecided_undecided': 4.0, 'against_undecided': 3.0, 'against_against': 32.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 7.0, 'for': 35.0, 'against': 58.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 32.0, 'for': 25.0, 'against': 43.0}}",John Donvan,mod,"Okay, you're-- you're--"

Peter Hitchens<against>: Columnist, Mail on Sunday & Fmr. Moscow Correspondent, Daily Express","John Donvan (role: mod): Did I say Soviet.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you.
John Donvan (role: mod): He also points out that that may underwrite the fact that Soviet diplomats get attention, they get time in-- sorry, Russian.
John Donvan (role: mod): Robert Blackwill, the side arguing against the motion, has said the ability of the Soviet Union to blow us up and perhaps ultimately their intentions to do so, make them highly, highly relevant to the United States and to the rest of the world.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's start with the most obvious: Nuclear weapons.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I think what we need to do is go through some of the issues that came up and talk about what they imply in terms of greatness or marginality or somewhere in between.
John Donvan (role: mod): What they're disagreeing about is what these things imply.
John Donvan (role: mod): Nobody's disagreeing about that.
John Donvan (role: mod): What I find interesting in what we've heard in the opening statements so far-- and this is rarely happens in our debates-- is that the two sides actually, I think, agree a hundred percent on the basic facts about what is happening in Russia, that it was a powerful nation, less powerful now, that it is led by a sinister tyrant, that its economy is a bit of a mess.
John Donvan (role: mod): More specifically, though, they argue that trying to define what-- what Russia is in terms of greatness or marginality, issues like friendship are irrelevant, that a nation that has nuclear weapons, a nation that can destroy New York City in half an hour, almost by definition is already not a nation that you can call marginal, even if you can't call it a great nation, necessarily.
John Donvan (role: mod): One of those partners argues that the anti-Russian narrative being heard from their opponents is in itself a sort of nostalgia for the Cold War and a yearning for an enemy.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Peter Hitchens and Robert Blackwill, they argue two ways on this one.
John Donvan (role: mod): It doesn't want to play as a responsible member of the international community.
John Donvan (role: mod): It contributes very little to the solving of great problems in the world; that Russia doesn't really want responsibility in the first place.
John Donvan (role: mod): The nation is paranoid.
John Donvan (role: mod): We've heard them argue that Russia could be a great nation, but it fails to meet that bar, that it has squandered the opportunities that it has innately and that have been given to it since the end of the Cold War.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing that Russia is a marginal power, Ian Bremmer and Edward Lucas.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing for and against the motion, Russia is a marginal power.
John Donvan (role: mod): Round two is where the debaters address one another directly, and they take questions from me and from you in our audience here in New York City.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now we move on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes opening statements in this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, where our motion is: Russia is a marginal power.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Robert Blackwill.
John Donvan (role: mod): What pushes Russia from the center of the game?
John Donvan (role: mod): It's how they use them.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): So those are facts.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): They take it seriously.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): And third, Russia has not delivered advanced air defense systems to Iran.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): So all three of those facts are wrong.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): The question again, just to remind ourselves, is not, is Russia a responsible power?
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): And we can list all the different ways.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): It's rather how important a power is it, and the nuclear weapons make it of consequence to the United States.
John Donvan (role: mod): Take that point about why you're, to some degree, hinging your argument on whether Russia is a grownup, mature player in the game.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): I mean, Russia is a nuclear superpower.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): That's nice.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): The fact is, we're not very concerned about their nukes.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): And just last year, finally, we said, well, you know, we've dealt with al-Qaeda at least in terms of the United States, just not for other countries, but now we're much more concerned about cyber as the principal concern for the United States.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): But in terms of the potential of a government to engage in cyber attacks against the U.S., that is head and shoulders, neck, body-- it's China above anybody else, above the Russians.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): What we are going to say is that alone doesn't actually cut it on the world stage today.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): We don't-- our strategic planning as a country and our prioritization and policy is not as if that is the principal thing that we are losing sleep over on a daily basis.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Well, I don't actually share this concern about nuclear weapons very much because I've come to the conclusion that they are more or less unusable, and I don't think anybody would-- since Harry Truman used them, I don't think anybody else will ever do so.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): But--
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Well, I do.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): But I think it is simply the absurdity in this is not about nuclear weapons as the absurdity is in the wishful thinking of those who would like there not to be a major power on the planet which differs from the United States on a number of very important objectives.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): We'd like it to be the case that we could globalize the world and sweep away borders to the extent they have.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): –It has a sort of supreme Soviet with no opposition.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): It is entirely lawless.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): And this is-- This is the body which we were supposedly--
Peter Hitchens (role: against): It has to do with the fact that there was-- what has provoked the immense international crisis in which we now find ourselves is not a struggle between freedom and tyranny.

John Donvan (role: mod): Okay, you're-- you're--
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Yeah.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): The issue of Ukraine’s international sovereignty is easily resolved.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Had it been that the United States had gone through a tremendous crisis in 1991 in which Mexico had been able to seduce the four states, which the United States took from it in 1848, back into some kind of independent republic, allowing the United States Navy use of San Diego, you'd have roughly the same circumstances, and you'd view it very much the same as the Russians.

Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): And as for cyber, the morning New York Times reports that there are major cyber attacks emanating from Russia against Ukraine today.
John Donvan (role: mod): Ian Bremmer.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): Look, the question is not, do nukes matter?
Ian Bremmer (role: for): Right?
Ian Bremmer (role: for): They got the Russia answer.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): China-- China most recently was number one.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): And the only other countries that ever make it into the top four are Iraq and North Korea.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): Look, when Obama came in, we sent over, as ambassador to Russia, Mike McFaul, guy I know very well, very capable guy, former Stanford prof. Did his PhD with me in Stanford, and is absolutely prodemocracy, pro-opposition.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): He meets with the opposition, clearly a red rag to a ball, right?
Ian Bremmer (role: for): We never would have sent over someone who would offend them that much.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): Because we care about China.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): It's big.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): It's called China, right?
Ian Bremmer (role: for): That's what Hillary said.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): Hillary just compared Putin to the Fuhrer, right?
Ian Bremmer (role: for): Because she can, because Russia doesn't matter as much to us.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): And perception is a part of reality.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me step in here because that's a really interesting point I want to bring back to Robert Blackwill or Peter Hitchens if you want to jump in on it as well, that in fact we are-- Russia is a marginal power with the evidence being the way that we all treat it.

Peter Hitchens (role: against): There's this curious template in discussing foreign policy of the second World War.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): You're Neville Chamberlain, and I am Winston Churchill.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): This is dribble.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): And one of them is Woodrow Wilson who nobody ever mentions, who created, pretty much, the second World War by drawing foolish, unsustainable borders all over Europe, which have now been entirely abolished by the European Union, by the way, under the agreement, which were, of course, the principal cause of the second World War.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): This idea that Russia is a marginal power, which is why it is a stupid idea and why you should reject it, was put forward in the chancelleries of the West when Russia was lying flat on its back at the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when NATO was pushed right up to the borders of Russia, something which all Russians believe they were promised would never happen.

Peter Hitchens (role: against): Oh, I think it’s childish.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): This is amazing the bad press that Putin gets.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): The selective criticism, and there's genuine criticism.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): There is a man called Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is in charge of Turkey, who locks up journalists in large numbers, who stages show trials of his political opponents, whose country and government is fantastically, spectacularly corrupt.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): And never a word, never a word.

John Donvan (role: mod): The Iranians at times have found the Russians crucial.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): No, that's right.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): And, again, I'd focus on the fact that unfortunately for Russia there's been a lot fewer, and they matter more in the global stage.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): I mean, there's no question that the Central African Republic finds Mali crucial right now.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): I think the point that Edward made, that Putin absolutely desperately demands attention, and he had to, he won-- you know, he had a diplomatic victory, a tactical one on Syria.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): We set a red line.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): And so we then tried to back off.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): And he couldn't leave it there.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): You know, it was the most read op-ed in the New York Times all year.

Ian Bremmer (role: for): He has no checks and balances on his decision making domestically at all.

Ian Bremmer (role: for): No, no.

Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): No, it isn't what-- no, I don't think it is what my opponents argue.

Edward Lucas (role: for): First of all, I think I-- it's easy to have a negative impact in the world.
Edward Lucas (role: for): Kill all your own people, pollute the environment, do horrible things.
Edward Lucas (role: for): It's not the ability to be a nuisance, it's the ability to have a positive impact.
Edward Lucas (role: for): It's absolutely true.
Edward Lucas (role: for): And because of the appalling way in which they've treated their customers, they're now seen as an expensive and unreliable supplier of gas, and people are making alternative arrangements.
Edward Lucas (role: for): We can get gasses, liquefied natural gas, from all over the place.
Edward Lucas (role: for): We've got gas coming from Algeria, from Norway, and everywhere else.
Edward Lucas (role: for): It's their fault.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): I just want to say the ability of Russia also to do negative things, it's significant compared to the positive, but it's also going down, not just because of the way they've acted on energy but because of the energy revolution.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): Its decreasing prices in Europe means the strangle-hold has been reduced.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): In the next five years, that’s going to grow dramatically.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): And it’s falling apart.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): Today, it’s $117, okay?
John Donvan (role: mod): That’s Peter Hitchens.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): It just means what Edward likes.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Quite a lot of us, for instance, think that the Arab Spring was not a wild success.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): And the destabilization of the Syrian Regime has reduced millions of people to abject misery, which was completely unnecessary.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): So, to be negative about these things is not necessarily to be bad.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me put to the-- to the-- to the side-arguing against the motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I’d like you to respond to it, whether that’s a marker of Russia’s standing in the world.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): I agree with you in that, over the long-term, the combination of the mismanagement of its energy sector by the Russians and the U.S. energy revolution that’s underway-- the shale revolution-- will reduce the Russian capacity to use energy as an instrument of its national purposes, especially against Western Europe.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): That’s 10 years-- that’s how long it takes to develop it.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): That’s Mary Poppins.

Peter Hitchens (role: against): Well, yes.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Again, this is-- it’s really crucial to understand that, in 1918, after Ludendorff had financed Lenin and the Bolsheviks to mount a coup d’etat against the then-Russian imperial government, which collapsed and surrendered in war.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): So humiliating that even Trotsky, one of the Bolsheviks, walked out of the talks rather than accept them and was forced to go back in.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): It’s interesting that exactly the same borders imposed on Russia in 1918 by the German kaiser have now been imposed on Russia again by NATO and the European Union.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): They won’t last now.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): If, as they say-- if somebody took back from the United States the countries which it captured in the War of 1848, which is a good deal more recent than the absorption of Ukraine into Russia, there would not be very long before there was a move to take them back, and a strong feeling that they did not belong in whatever organization they found themselves in.

Peter Hitchens<against>: Columnist, Mail on Sunday & Fmr. Moscow Correspondent, Daily Express","John Donvan (role: mod): I want to remind you that we are on the question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have four debaters-- two teams of two-- debating this motion: Russia is a marginal power.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Well, yes.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Again, this is-- it’s really crucial to understand that, in 1918, after Ludendorff had financed Lenin and the Bolsheviks to mount a coup d’etat against the then-Russian imperial government, which collapsed and surrendered in war.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): So humiliating that even Trotsky, one of the Bolsheviks, walked out of the talks rather than accept them and was forced to go back in.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): It’s interesting that exactly the same borders imposed on Russia in 1918 by the German kaiser have now been imposed on Russia again by NATO and the European Union.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): They won’t last now.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): If, as they say-- if somebody took back from the United States the countries which it captured in the War of 1848, which is a good deal more recent than the absorption of Ukraine into Russia, there would not be very long before there was a move to take them back, and a strong feeling that they did not belong in whatever organization they found themselves in.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Just remember that Russia is a country.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): And it exists in a hard, cruel world that’s been repeatedly invaded by Tatars, Swedes, Lithuanians, Germans, the Japanese, the Chinese, anybody who happens to be--
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me--
John Donvan (role: mod): Peter--
John Donvan (role: mod): Peter.
John Donvan (role: mod): This is the moderator speaking.
John Donvan (role: mod): Peter.
John Donvan (role: mod): Why does that, therefore, fight the argument that Russia is a marginal power?
Peter Hitchens (role: against): That was in the head of George Bush Senior.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): And that’s what they designed.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): And it won’t last.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): I’ll just say very quickly, which is that I actually think it’s a mistake for the United States to address as if it’s a marginal power because you’re actually just sticking Putin’s face in it.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): The fact that the Americans have pushed the Russians as hard as they have on Ukraine, which was critical to them, had been theirs, and which the West is going to win most of, right?
Ian Bremmer (role: for): But that’s not good enough for us.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): And, as a consequence, the Russians are going to get more antsy and uppity.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): And we’re going to have a few more weeks of headlines around this.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): That just means that we can’t help ourselves, because we’re always right about this stuff, right?
Ian Bremmer (role: for): I just don’t think it sways the way you should vote on this thing.
John Donvan (role: mod): I’m sorry.

John Donvan (role: mod): In the definition that was just given by your opponent about Russia being a crucial power, geographically and in time and place.

John Donvan (role: mod): Edward Lucas.
Edward Lucas (role: for): But Russia's not a crucial part on all the stuff that we would be doing if Russia wasn't being such a nuisance.
Edward Lucas (role: for): He craves attention.
Edward Lucas (role: for): All these foreign leaders are calling me.
Edward Lucas (role: for): And it's almost a behavior of a sort of disturbed adolescent.
Edward Lucas (role: for): It's deranged delusional behavior from somebody who doesn't understand that the world has changed.
Edward Lucas (role: for): He's-- perhaps-- just a moment.
Edward Lucas (role: for): They're strategic blunders.
John Donvan (role: mod): Peter Hitchens.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): There's this curious template in discussing foreign policy of the second World War.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): You're Neville Chamberlain, and I am Winston Churchill.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): This is dribble.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): And one of them is Woodrow Wilson who nobody ever mentions, who created, pretty much, the second World War by drawing foolish, unsustainable borders all over Europe, which have now been entirely abolished by the European Union, by the way, under the agreement, which were, of course, the principal cause of the second World War.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): This idea that Russia is a marginal power, which is why it is a stupid idea and why you should reject it, was put forward in the chancelleries of the West when Russia was lying flat on its back at the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when NATO was pushed right up to the borders of Russia, something which all Russians believe they were promised would never happen.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): It has rebounded on us in the Ukraine.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): It will rebound on us in many, many other ways.
John Donvan (role: mod): And Peter--
John Donvan (role: mod): And Peter, your-- in a response also to your opponent Edward Lucas' description at what's motivating Putin.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Oh, I think it’s childish.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): This is amazing the bad press that Putin gets.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): The selective criticism, and there's genuine criticism.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): There is a man called Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is in charge of Turkey, who locks up journalists in large numbers, who stages show trials of his political opponents, whose country and government is fantastically, spectacularly corrupt.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): And never a word, never a word.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): One of his victims of the attacks in the square demonstrations died yesterday as a result of having a tear gas canister fired on the side of his head.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): This is a disgraceful person.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): He is in favor of away borders so--
John Donvan (role: mod): Ian Bremmer.
John Donvan (role: mod): Ian Bremmer, Ian Bremmer, now, your partner has said that the Ukrainians at this moment would find the Russians crucial.
John Donvan (role: mod): The Iranians at times have found the Russians crucial.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): No, that's right.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): And, again, I'd focus on the fact that unfortunately for Russia there's been a lot fewer, and they matter more in the global stage.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): I mean, there's no question that the Central African Republic finds Mali crucial right now.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): I think the point that Edward made, that Putin absolutely desperately demands attention, and he had to, he won-- you know, he had a diplomatic victory, a tactical one on Syria.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): We set a red line.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): And so we then tried to back off.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): And he couldn't leave it there.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): You know, it was the most read op-ed in the New York Times all year.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): I really believe that.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): He has no checks and balances on his decision making domestically at all.

Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): Empirically, as I said, the American president, the British prime minister, the German chancellor, the Italian prime minister spent hours on the phone we all know with Putin, trying to persuade him to change Russian policy toward Ukraine and the Crimea.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): These busy, busy leaders don't do that with a marginal power.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): So it-- they're not being treated by the international system as if they're marginal.

Edward Lucas (role: for): He's-- perhaps-- just a moment.
Edward Lucas (role: for): They're strategic blunders.
John Donvan (role: mod): Peter Hitchens.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): There's this curious template in discussing foreign policy of the second World War.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): You're Neville Chamberlain, and I am Winston Churchill.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): This is dribble.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): And one of them is Woodrow Wilson who nobody ever mentions, who created, pretty much, the second World War by drawing foolish, unsustainable borders all over Europe, which have now been entirely abolished by the European Union, by the way, under the agreement, which were, of course, the principal cause of the second World War.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): This idea that Russia is a marginal power, which is why it is a stupid idea and why you should reject it, was put forward in the chancelleries of the West when Russia was lying flat on its back at the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, when NATO was pushed right up to the borders of Russia, something which all Russians believe they were promised would never happen.

John Donvan (role: mod): Ian Bremmer, so take that point that your side made, that in a sense, the responsibility of a nation defines its greatness, its centrality or its marginality in its absence.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): I think our argument has a lot to do with whether or not its power is relevant and useable in the world today.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): It's also a sugar beet superpower.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): Borscht would be unmakable in this country, were it not for Russia.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): For the last ten plus years, we've been most concerned about the war on terror.

John Donvan (role: mod): Now we move on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): Round two is where the debaters address one another directly, and they take questions from me and from you in our audience here in New York City.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing for and against the motion, Russia is a marginal power.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing that Russia is a marginal power, Ian Bremmer and Edward Lucas.
John Donvan (role: mod): We've heard them argue that Russia could be a great nation, but it fails to meet that bar, that it has squandered the opportunities that it has innately and that have been given to it since the end of the Cold War.
John Donvan (role: mod): The nation is paranoid.
John Donvan (role: mod): It contributes very little to the solving of great problems in the world; that Russia doesn't really want responsibility in the first place.
John Donvan (role: mod): It doesn't want to play as a responsible member of the international community.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Peter Hitchens and Robert Blackwill, they argue two ways on this one.
John Donvan (role: mod): One of those partners argues that the anti-Russian narrative being heard from their opponents is in itself a sort of nostalgia for the Cold War and a yearning for an enemy.
John Donvan (role: mod): More specifically, though, they argue that trying to define what-- what Russia is in terms of greatness or marginality, issues like friendship are irrelevant, that a nation that has nuclear weapons, a nation that can destroy New York City in half an hour, almost by definition is already not a nation that you can call marginal, even if you can't call it a great nation, necessarily.
John Donvan (role: mod): What I find interesting in what we've heard in the opening statements so far-- and this is rarely happens in our debates-- is that the two sides actually, I think, agree a hundred percent on the basic facts about what is happening in Russia, that it was a powerful nation, less powerful now, that it is led by a sinister tyrant, that its economy is a bit of a mess.
John Donvan (role: mod): Nobody's disagreeing about that.
John Donvan (role: mod): What they're disagreeing about is what these things imply.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I think what we need to do is go through some of the issues that came up and talk about what they imply in terms of greatness or marginality or somewhere in between.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's start with the most obvious: Nuclear weapons.
John Donvan (role: mod): Robert Blackwill, the side arguing against the motion, has said the ability of the Soviet Union to blow us up and perhaps ultimately their intentions to do so, make them highly, highly relevant to the United States and to the rest of the world.
John Donvan (role: mod): He also points out that that may underwrite the fact that Soviet diplomats get attention, they get time in-- sorry, Russian.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you.
John Donvan (role: mod): Did I say Soviet.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): Twice.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's go back and do that whole thing over again.
John Donvan (role: mod): for the record, and for our radio listeners, I lived there during the Soviets, and I can't get it out of my head.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I mean Russian.
John Donvan (role: mod): Every time I've said, ""Soviets"" so far, almost all of those times.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's go to the side, though, that's arguing for it, the motion, Russia is a marginal power, and take on this issue of nuclear capability that Russia still possesses, which your opponents say all by itself makes-- makes it impossible to call Russia a marginal power.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's take that to Ed Lucas.
Edward Lucas (role: for): Well, as I said, almost my opening words, Russia is a nuclear superpower.
Edward Lucas (role: for): It's worth bearing in mind, of course, that having the nuclear war heads is one thing, and delivering them is another.
Edward Lucas (role: for): And the record of the Russian Navy, of building new strategic submarines is pretty-- pretty patchy, even by the lamentable standards of defense procurement contracts worldwide.
Edward Lucas (role: for): And there's something slightly comic about seeing the old bear bombers which look like something out of Dr. Strangelove lumbering up to Guam and other places in NATO air space to try and provoke us and scare us.
Edward Lucas (role: for): And you kind of wonder if the rubber bands and gaffer tape or duct tape is still holding it together all right.
Edward Lucas (role: for): I worry about the security of the Soviet-- Russian-- ex-Soviet and now Russian…it’s catching--
John Donvan (role: mod): Yeah, yeah, very.
Edward Lucas (role: for): --of a nuclear arsenal.
Edward Lucas (role: for): But I just want to-- also, if I may, just pick up on one-- I don't really--
John Donvan (role: mod): But just to the point then, you're saying that that capability is rather irrelevant to--

John Donvan (role: mod): In the definition that was just given by your opponent about Russia being a crucial power, geographically and in time and place.

Edward Lucas (role: for): Well, it's there in the sense that if Putin goes mad or even madder, yes, he can do a Dr. Strangelove, and he can blow the world up, and that is indeed something to worry about.
Edward Lucas (role: for): But I think you have to ask, how does he use that power?
Edward Lucas (role: for): What is he using that power for?
Edward Lucas (role: for): How does he take that power and put Russia at the center of world affairs.
Edward Lucas (role: for): Is he helping, for example, to deal with nonproliferation.
Edward Lucas (role: for): That would be a really good thing for a nuclear superpower to do, to try to make sure we deal with nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, maybe put pressure on North Korea so that they don't develop their nuclear.
Edward Lucas (role: for): That's what a responsible, what a mainstream nuclear power would do.
Edward Lucas (role: for): Russia's not involved in that.
Edward Lucas (role: for): On the contrary, it's actually constantly threatening to sell advanced systems to Iran which will give the Iranians more time and more protection for their nuclear program.
Edward Lucas (role: for): They certainly played no role in helping to--
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
Edward Lucas (role: for): --deal with North Korea.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's take some of what you just said back to Robert Blackwill, where we hear Edward Luke was again arguing on this issue of what's marginality?
John Donvan (role: mod): And he's saying the weapons are irrelevant.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): Well, first of all, Russia is modernizing all three legs of its strategic deterrent, its delivery systems.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): Unlike the United States, Russia has active programs, missile programs, submarine programs and aircraft programs to deliver its nuclear weapons.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): Second, Russia is involved in the North Korean diplomacy.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): They haven't done so.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): With respect to nuclear weapons and our colleagues admit that it is a superpower.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): We all agree it's not a responsible power.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): But that's not what the subject tonight is about.
John Donvan (role: mod): Ian Bremmer, so take that point that your side made, that in a sense, the responsibility of a nation defines its greatness, its centrality or its marginality in its absence.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): I think our argument has a lot to do with whether or not its power is relevant and useable in the world today.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): It's also a sugar beet superpower.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): Borscht would be unmakable in this country, were it not for Russia.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): For the last ten plus years, we've been most concerned about the war on terror.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): And, of course, in terms of cyber attacks, the Russians have a lot of criminals.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): So, yes, we're not going to deny the fact that Russia has 10,000 nuclear warheads.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): We're certainly not acting as if it cuts it.
John Donvan (role: mod): Peter Hitchens.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): It is noticeable what the Russians did develop in the first part of the 21st century.
John Donvan (role: mod): But does that mean you're agreeing with your opponent?
Peter Hitchens (role: against): I can't sit here and honestly say that I-- well, I don't believe.

Edward Lucas (role: for): --of a nuclear arsenal.
John Donvan (role: mod): Yeah, yeah, very.
Edward Lucas (role: for): I worry about the security of the Soviet-- Russian-- ex-Soviet and now Russian…it’s catching--
Edward Lucas (role: for): And you kind of wonder if the rubber bands and gaffer tape or duct tape is still holding it together all right.
Edward Lucas (role: for): And there's something slightly comic about seeing the old bear bombers which look like something out of Dr. Strangelove lumbering up to Guam and other places in NATO air space to try and provoke us and scare us.
Edward Lucas (role: for): And the record of the Russian Navy, of building new strategic submarines is pretty-- pretty patchy, even by the lamentable standards of defense procurement contracts worldwide.
Edward Lucas (role: for): It's worth bearing in mind, of course, that having the nuclear war heads is one thing, and delivering them is another.
Edward Lucas (role: for): Well, as I said, almost my opening words, Russia is a nuclear superpower.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's take that to Ed Lucas.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's go to the side, though, that's arguing for it, the motion, Russia is a marginal power, and take on this issue of nuclear capability that Russia still possesses, which your opponents say all by itself makes-- makes it impossible to call Russia a marginal power.
John Donvan (role: mod): Every time I've said, ""Soviets"" so far, almost all of those times.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I mean Russian.
John Donvan (role: mod): for the record, and for our radio listeners, I lived there during the Soviets, and I can't get it out of my head.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's go back and do that whole thing over again.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): Twice.
John Donvan (role: mod): Did I say Soviet.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you.
John Donvan (role: mod): He also points out that that may underwrite the fact that Soviet diplomats get attention, they get time in-- sorry, Russian.
John Donvan (role: mod): Robert Blackwill, the side arguing against the motion, has said the ability of the Soviet Union to blow us up and perhaps ultimately their intentions to do so, make them highly, highly relevant to the United States and to the rest of the world.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's start with the most obvious: Nuclear weapons.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I think what we need to do is go through some of the issues that came up and talk about what they imply in terms of greatness or marginality or somewhere in between.
John Donvan (role: mod): What they're disagreeing about is what these things imply.
John Donvan (role: mod): Nobody's disagreeing about that.
John Donvan (role: mod): What I find interesting in what we've heard in the opening statements so far-- and this is rarely happens in our debates-- is that the two sides actually, I think, agree a hundred percent on the basic facts about what is happening in Russia, that it was a powerful nation, less powerful now, that it is led by a sinister tyrant, that its economy is a bit of a mess.
John Donvan (role: mod): More specifically, though, they argue that trying to define what-- what Russia is in terms of greatness or marginality, issues like friendship are irrelevant, that a nation that has nuclear weapons, a nation that can destroy New York City in half an hour, almost by definition is already not a nation that you can call marginal, even if you can't call it a great nation, necessarily.
John Donvan (role: mod): One of those partners argues that the anti-Russian narrative being heard from their opponents is in itself a sort of nostalgia for the Cold War and a yearning for an enemy.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Peter Hitchens and Robert Blackwill, they argue two ways on this one.
John Donvan (role: mod): It doesn't want to play as a responsible member of the international community.
John Donvan (role: mod): It contributes very little to the solving of great problems in the world; that Russia doesn't really want responsibility in the first place.
John Donvan (role: mod): The nation is paranoid.
John Donvan (role: mod): We've heard them argue that Russia could be a great nation, but it fails to meet that bar, that it has squandered the opportunities that it has innately and that have been given to it since the end of the Cold War.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing that Russia is a marginal power, Ian Bremmer and Edward Lucas.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing for and against the motion, Russia is a marginal power.
John Donvan (role: mod): Round two is where the debaters address one another directly, and they take questions from me and from you in our audience here in New York City.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now we move on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes opening statements in this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, where our motion is: Russia is a marginal power.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Robert Blackwill.
John Donvan (role: mod): What pushes Russia from the center of the game?
John Donvan (role: mod): It's how they use them.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): So those are facts.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): They take it seriously.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): And third, Russia has not delivered advanced air defense systems to Iran.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): So all three of those facts are wrong.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): The question again, just to remind ourselves, is not, is Russia a responsible power?
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): And we can list all the different ways.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): It's rather how important a power is it, and the nuclear weapons make it of consequence to the United States.
John Donvan (role: mod): Take that point about why you're, to some degree, hinging your argument on whether Russia is a grownup, mature player in the game.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): I mean, Russia is a nuclear superpower.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): That's nice.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): The fact is, we're not very concerned about their nukes.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): And just last year, finally, we said, well, you know, we've dealt with al-Qaeda at least in terms of the United States, just not for other countries, but now we're much more concerned about cyber as the principal concern for the United States.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): But in terms of the potential of a government to engage in cyber attacks against the U.S., that is head and shoulders, neck, body-- it's China above anybody else, above the Russians.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): What we are going to say is that alone doesn't actually cut it on the world stage today.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): We don't-- our strategic planning as a country and our prioritization and policy is not as if that is the principal thing that we are losing sleep over on a daily basis.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Well, I don't actually share this concern about nuclear weapons very much because I've come to the conclusion that they are more or less unusable, and I don't think anybody would-- since Harry Truman used them, I don't think anybody else will ever do so.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): But--
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Well, I do.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): But I think it is simply the absurdity in this is not about nuclear weapons as the absurdity is in the wishful thinking of those who would like there not to be a major power on the planet which differs from the United States on a number of very important objectives.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): We'd like it to be the case that we could globalize the world and sweep away borders to the extent they have.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 9.0, 'undecided_for': 12.0, 'for_against': 9.0, 'for_for': 14.0, 'undecided_against': 17.0, 'for_undecided': 1.0, 'undecided_undecided': 4.0, 'against_undecided': 3.0, 'against_against': 32.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 7.0, 'for': 35.0, 'against': 58.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 32.0, 'for': 25.0, 'against': 43.0}}",Peter Hitchens,against,–It has a sort of supreme Soviet with no opposition.

John Donvan (role: mod): I want to remind you that we are on the question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have four debaters-- two teams of two-- debating this motion: Russia is a marginal power.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Well, yes.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Again, this is-- it’s really crucial to understand that, in 1918, after Ludendorff had financed Lenin and the Bolsheviks to mount a coup d’etat against the then-Russian imperial government, which collapsed and surrendered in war.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): So humiliating that even Trotsky, one of the Bolsheviks, walked out of the talks rather than accept them and was forced to go back in.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): It’s interesting that exactly the same borders imposed on Russia in 1918 by the German kaiser have now been imposed on Russia again by NATO and the European Union.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): They won’t last now.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): If, as they say-- if somebody took back from the United States the countries which it captured in the War of 1848, which is a good deal more recent than the absorption of Ukraine into Russia, there would not be very long before there was a move to take them back, and a strong feeling that they did not belong in whatever organization they found themselves in.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Just remember that Russia is a country.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): And it exists in a hard, cruel world that’s been repeatedly invaded by Tatars, Swedes, Lithuanians, Germans, the Japanese, the Chinese, anybody who happens to be--

John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Peter Hitchens and Robert Blackwill, they argue two ways on this one.
John Donvan (role: mod): One of those partners argues that the anti-Russian narrative being heard from their opponents is in itself a sort of nostalgia for the Cold War and a yearning for an enemy.
John Donvan (role: mod): More specifically, though, they argue that trying to define what-- what Russia is in terms of greatness or marginality, issues like friendship are irrelevant, that a nation that has nuclear weapons, a nation that can destroy New York City in half an hour, almost by definition is already not a nation that you can call marginal, even if you can't call it a great nation, necessarily.
John Donvan (role: mod): What I find interesting in what we've heard in the opening statements so far-- and this is rarely happens in our debates-- is that the two sides actually, I think, agree a hundred percent on the basic facts about what is happening in Russia, that it was a powerful nation, less powerful now, that it is led by a sinister tyrant, that its economy is a bit of a mess.
John Donvan (role: mod): Nobody's disagreeing about that.
John Donvan (role: mod): What they're disagreeing about is what these things imply.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I think what we need to do is go through some of the issues that came up and talk about what they imply in terms of greatness or marginality or somewhere in between.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's start with the most obvious: Nuclear weapons.
John Donvan (role: mod): Robert Blackwill, the side arguing against the motion, has said the ability of the Soviet Union to blow us up and perhaps ultimately their intentions to do so, make them highly, highly relevant to the United States and to the rest of the world.
John Donvan (role: mod): He also points out that that may underwrite the fact that Soviet diplomats get attention, they get time in-- sorry, Russian.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you.
John Donvan (role: mod): Did I say Soviet.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): Twice.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's go back and do that whole thing over again.
John Donvan (role: mod): for the record, and for our radio listeners, I lived there during the Soviets, and I can't get it out of my head.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I mean Russian.
John Donvan (role: mod): Every time I've said, ""Soviets"" so far, almost all of those times.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's go to the side, though, that's arguing for it, the motion, Russia is a marginal power, and take on this issue of nuclear capability that Russia still possesses, which your opponents say all by itself makes-- makes it impossible to call Russia a marginal power.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's take that to Ed Lucas.
Edward Lucas (role: for): Well, as I said, almost my opening words, Russia is a nuclear superpower.
Edward Lucas (role: for): It's worth bearing in mind, of course, that having the nuclear war heads is one thing, and delivering them is another.
Edward Lucas (role: for): And the record of the Russian Navy, of building new strategic submarines is pretty-- pretty patchy, even by the lamentable standards of defense procurement contracts worldwide.
Edward Lucas (role: for): And there's something slightly comic about seeing the old bear bombers which look like something out of Dr. Strangelove lumbering up to Guam and other places in NATO air space to try and provoke us and scare us.
Edward Lucas (role: for): And you kind of wonder if the rubber bands and gaffer tape or duct tape is still holding it together all right.
Edward Lucas (role: for): I worry about the security of the Soviet-- Russian-- ex-Soviet and now Russian…it’s catching--
John Donvan (role: mod): Yeah, yeah, very.
Edward Lucas (role: for): --of a nuclear arsenal.
Edward Lucas (role: for): But I just want to-- also, if I may, just pick up on one-- I don't really--
John Donvan (role: mod): But just to the point then, you're saying that that capability is rather irrelevant to--
Edward Lucas (role: for): Well, it's there in the sense that if Putin goes mad or even madder, yes, he can do a Dr. Strangelove, and he can blow the world up, and that is indeed something to worry about.
Edward Lucas (role: for): But I think you have to ask, how does he use that power?
Edward Lucas (role: for): What is he using that power for?
Edward Lucas (role: for): How does he take that power and put Russia at the center of world affairs.
Edward Lucas (role: for): Is he helping, for example, to deal with nonproliferation.
Edward Lucas (role: for): That would be a really good thing for a nuclear superpower to do, to try to make sure we deal with nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, maybe put pressure on North Korea so that they don't develop their nuclear.
Edward Lucas (role: for): That's what a responsible, what a mainstream nuclear power would do.
Edward Lucas (role: for): Russia's not involved in that.
Edward Lucas (role: for): On the contrary, it's actually constantly threatening to sell advanced systems to Iran which will give the Iranians more time and more protection for their nuclear program.
Edward Lucas (role: for): They certainly played no role in helping to--
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
Edward Lucas (role: for): --deal with North Korea.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's take some of what you just said back to Robert Blackwill, where we hear Edward Luke was again arguing on this issue of what's marginality?
John Donvan (role: mod): And he's saying the weapons are irrelevant.

John Donvan (role: mod): He also points out that that may underwrite the fact that Soviet diplomats get attention, they get time in-- sorry, Russian.
John Donvan (role: mod): Robert Blackwill, the side arguing against the motion, has said the ability of the Soviet Union to blow us up and perhaps ultimately their intentions to do so, make them highly, highly relevant to the United States and to the rest of the world.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's start with the most obvious: Nuclear weapons.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I think what we need to do is go through some of the issues that came up and talk about what they imply in terms of greatness or marginality or somewhere in between.
John Donvan (role: mod): What they're disagreeing about is what these things imply.
John Donvan (role: mod): Nobody's disagreeing about that.
John Donvan (role: mod): What I find interesting in what we've heard in the opening statements so far-- and this is rarely happens in our debates-- is that the two sides actually, I think, agree a hundred percent on the basic facts about what is happening in Russia, that it was a powerful nation, less powerful now, that it is led by a sinister tyrant, that its economy is a bit of a mess.
John Donvan (role: mod): More specifically, though, they argue that trying to define what-- what Russia is in terms of greatness or marginality, issues like friendship are irrelevant, that a nation that has nuclear weapons, a nation that can destroy New York City in half an hour, almost by definition is already not a nation that you can call marginal, even if you can't call it a great nation, necessarily.
John Donvan (role: mod): One of those partners argues that the anti-Russian narrative being heard from their opponents is in itself a sort of nostalgia for the Cold War and a yearning for an enemy.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Peter Hitchens and Robert Blackwill, they argue two ways on this one.
John Donvan (role: mod): It doesn't want to play as a responsible member of the international community.
John Donvan (role: mod): It contributes very little to the solving of great problems in the world; that Russia doesn't really want responsibility in the first place.
John Donvan (role: mod): The nation is paranoid.
John Donvan (role: mod): We've heard them argue that Russia could be a great nation, but it fails to meet that bar, that it has squandered the opportunities that it has innately and that have been given to it since the end of the Cold War.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing that Russia is a marginal power, Ian Bremmer and Edward Lucas.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing for and against the motion, Russia is a marginal power.
John Donvan (role: mod): Round two is where the debaters address one another directly, and they take questions from me and from you in our audience here in New York City.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now we move on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes opening statements in this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, where our motion is: Russia is a marginal power.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Robert Blackwill.
John Donvan (role: mod): What pushes Russia from the center of the game?
John Donvan (role: mod): It's how they use them.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): So those are facts.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): They take it seriously.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): And third, Russia has not delivered advanced air defense systems to Iran.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): So all three of those facts are wrong.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): The question again, just to remind ourselves, is not, is Russia a responsible power?
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): And we can list all the different ways.
Amb. Robert D. Blackwill (role: against): It's rather how important a power is it, and the nuclear weapons make it of consequence to the United States.
John Donvan (role: mod): Take that point about why you're, to some degree, hinging your argument on whether Russia is a grownup, mature player in the game.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): I mean, Russia is a nuclear superpower.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): That's nice.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): The fact is, we're not very concerned about their nukes.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): And just last year, finally, we said, well, you know, we've dealt with al-Qaeda at least in terms of the United States, just not for other countries, but now we're much more concerned about cyber as the principal concern for the United States.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): But in terms of the potential of a government to engage in cyber attacks against the U.S., that is head and shoulders, neck, body-- it's China above anybody else, above the Russians.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): What we are going to say is that alone doesn't actually cut it on the world stage today.
Ian Bremmer (role: for): We don't-- our strategic planning as a country and our prioritization and policy is not as if that is the principal thing that we are losing sleep over on a daily basis.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): Well, I don't actually share this concern about nuclear weapons very much because I've come to the conclusion that they are more or less unusable, and I don't think anybody would-- since Harry Truman used them, I don't think anybody else will ever do so.
Peter Hitchens (role: against): But--","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 9.0, 'undecided_for': 12.0, 'for_against': 9.0, 'for_for': 14.0, 'undecided_against': 17.0, 'for_undecided': 1.0, 'undecided_undecided': 4.0, 'against_undecided': 3.0, 'against_against': 32.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 7.0, 'for': 35.0, 'against': 58.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 32.0, 'for': 25.0, 'against': 43.0}}",Peter Hitchens,against,"Well, I do."

John Donvan (role: mod): Now you’ve heard the opening round.
John Donvan (role: mod): Remember how you voted just before the opening round, because we’re going to have you vote immediately after all of the arguments and after round three, and the team whose numbers have changed the most over the course of your two votes in percentage point terms will be declared our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): Round two is where the debaters address one and another directly and answer questions from me and from you, our live audience here in Washington, DC.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing out on this motion: Spy on My, I’d Rather be Safe.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team that’s arguing for this motion, Richard Falkenrath and Stewart Baker, make the argument that there are no simple answers to this; yes, there is a conflict between privacy and security, but that on the whole the mass surveillance programs such as were exposed in 2013 regarding the NSA and phone records and Verizon-- that by and large that those programs work, that they are protected by safeguards.
John Donvan (role: mod): Those safeguards are legally sanctioned and the result of years and years of concern about how to incorporate privacy into the activities-- respect for privacy into the activities of the intelligence community.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Michael German and David Cole, they’re arguing against this motion, Spy on Me, I’d Rather be Safe.
John Donvan (role: mod): They’re saying yes, there are threats and there does need to be surveillance, but that basically a government that’s able to fish in this sea of data is a government that’s exceeding its position in democratic society.
John Donvan (role: mod): The violation of privacy goes too far.
John Donvan (role: mod): The failure to be transparent goes too far, and that in any case, the system would be flooded with so much data in such a situation that it actually becomes counterproductive to have that information on citizens who have done nothing wrong.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go to the side that’s arguing for this motion, that’s more comfortable with the surveillance programs that are in place, and say to you that your opponents have made the argument that-- well, one of them in particular, he said this program that the NSA conducted really affronted his sense of privacy, just in a very basic way.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now you-- your side, you’re not denying the fact that to some degree there is a compromise of privacy.
John Donvan (role: mod): It’s just not enough to count, and I want to know why that is.
John Donvan (role: mod): Where is your line, Stewart Baker, on just how willing to be spied on you are?
Stewart Baker (role: for): There’s no doubt that when the government collects data, everybody in the democracy ought to be concerned and want to make sure that it is handled in as privacy-protected a fashion as possible, consistent with actually having it be effective.
Stewart Baker (role: for): The difficulty here is-- or the protections here are built in to the back end of the system.
Stewart Baker (role: for): That is to say the government has the data, but just because it has it doesn’t mean it’s allowed to look at it.
Stewart Baker (role: for): It’s set up a whole set of rules, court enforced, aggressively audited, limited number of people who can get access to this data, and clear rules for when they can do it.
Stewart Baker (role: for): To make it much more like the rules that apply to ordinary searches by law enforcement, which is you have a suspicion, and you ask a question about the person or the-- in this case, the phone number that you have a suspicion about.
Stewart Baker (role: for): They don’t have any ability to look at people for--
John Donvan (role: mod): So in answer to my question, if the safeguards were not in place, you would have a great deal more concern?
Stewart Baker (role: for): Yes, absolutely.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right, so let me take that to the other side.
John Donvan (role: mod): They’re arguing that in fact while the data is there, that there are built in safeguards, and those things are for real.
John Donvan (role: mod): You know, there’s a process through which governments need to go in-- or that the government needs to know to go in order to dig more deeply into that pile of data, but Michael German, do you trust in the safeguards?
John Donvan (role: mod): Or what is your response to their basic argument that maybe it’s not so nice, but it’s safe?
Michael German (role: against): Well, I guess the easy two-word response would be Edward Snowden, right?
Michael German (role: against): If this data and all this stuff was so protected and so well regulated and so controlled, how would Edward Snowden have gotten so much access to it?
Michael German (role: against): And luckily, because Edward Snowden did get so much access to it, and because we’re still benefiting even this week from information that’s coming forward, what has become clearer and clearer is that the FISA court was being-- that the NSA was misrepresenting the program, I’ll say that in the nicest way.
Michael German (role: against): And continually going beyond the scope of the minimization procedures and rules to the extent that in 2011, Judge Bates said it was unconstitutional
John Donvan (role: mod): Bottom line, then, are you saying that you don't trust the system?
Michael German (role: against): I don't trust any system that doesn't have effective public oversight.
John Donvan (role: mod): Richard Falkenrath.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It's worth-- There's a few things that \-- neither do Stewart or I.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): We think it's effective in this case.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): And you’ve left out a few facts.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): So this program, the one that draws your ire so strongly, the bulk acquisition of telephone call records.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): First point: The Supreme Court has held, since the late '70s, that this data, like what number called what number at what time for how long is not privacy information.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Getting it from the government is not a search.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Now, professor Cole and his scholarship on this is against that and thinks the Supreme Court got it wrong.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Nonetheless, the Supreme Court, for 35 years, has held this consistently.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Second, going beyond what is strictly necessary from what the Supreme Court says, the Congress has authorized this provision.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It's called section 215.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It was in the Patriot Act.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It amended the FISA court regulation.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): People on your side of this debate were against it then, and you're still against it now.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): 215 was very controversial then.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It's still controversial now among the same people.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): But finally, you leave out the fact that this program, the bulk acquisition of telephone call records for narrow counterterrorism purposes has been authorized 34 times by 14 different federal judges, who wrote, in writing, they said they would not have authorized it but for the safeguards in place.

Richard Falkenrath (role: for): First point: The Supreme Court has held, since the late '70s, that this data, like what number called what number at what time for how long is not privacy information.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Getting it from the government is not a search.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Now, professor Cole and his scholarship on this is against that and thinks the Supreme Court got it wrong.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Nonetheless, the Supreme Court, for 35 years, has held this consistently.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Second, going beyond what is strictly necessary from what the Supreme Court says, the Congress has authorized this provision.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It's called section 215.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It was in the Patriot Act.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It amended the FISA court regulation.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): People on your side of this debate were against it then, and you're still against it now.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): 215 was very controversial then.

John Donvan (role: mod): The failure to be transparent goes too far, and that in any case, the system would be flooded with so much data in such a situation that it actually becomes counterproductive to have that information on citizens who have done nothing wrong.
John Donvan (role: mod): The violation of privacy goes too far.

John Donvan (role: mod): Those safeguards are legally sanctioned and the result of years and years of concern about how to incorporate privacy into the activities-- respect for privacy into the activities of the intelligence community.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team that’s arguing for this motion, Richard Falkenrath and Stewart Baker, make the argument that there are no simple answers to this; yes, there is a conflict between privacy and security, but that on the whole the mass surveillance programs such as were exposed in 2013 regarding the NSA and phone records and Verizon-- that by and large that those programs work, that they are protected by safeguards.

Stewart Baker (role: for): What they didn't know is that the al-Qaeda operative was planning the hijacking in the United States.
Stewart Baker (role: for): If they had known months before the attack that somebody was inside the United States at that high rank within al-Qaeda, there would have been an all-points bulletin for that person.

Stewart Baker (role: for): No one is allowed to search this data without a reasonable articulable suspicion.
Stewart Baker (role: for): And, look, the question I thought was an excellent one, ""Why would you do that if there's an alternative?""

John Donvan (role: mod): The failure to be transparent goes too far, and that in any case, the system would be flooded with so much data in such a situation that it actually becomes counterproductive to have that information on citizens who have done nothing wrong.

John Donvan (role: mod): The team that’s arguing for this motion, Richard Falkenrath and Stewart Baker, make the argument that there are no simple answers to this; yes, there is a conflict between privacy and security, but that on the whole the mass surveillance programs such as were exposed in 2013 regarding the NSA and phone records and Verizon-- that by and large that those programs work, that they are protected by safeguards.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing out on this motion: Spy on My, I’d Rather be Safe.

David Cole (role: against): Mike Hayden, the former head of NSA, CIA, has said, “if I can get all of that phone data about who you've called over a period of time, I don't need to listen to what you're saying.
David Cole (role: against): This stuff is more private than the content itself.”
David Cole (role: against): Well, first of all, Richard's point about the Supreme Court was-- Supreme Court has not found that the safeguards are credible here.
David Cole (role: against): Immediately Congress responded and said, yes, we do have an expectation of privacy.
David Cole (role: against): This law, the government has now turned around and perverted, in secret, to get the very information that Congress originally said we shouldn't get, and to get not just the data with respect to one suspect, which is what was at issue in the Supreme Court case in the '70s, but to get every piece of phone data of every one of us every time we make a call.

John Donvan (role: mod): David, but I don't think that I-- I directly heard an answer or an articulated answer to why you don't trust the safeguards that-- you said they're not credible after Richard actually made a pretty good point that the Supreme Court has time and again and legislation-- why don't you find them credible?
David Cole (role: against): What the Supreme Court found was that in the '70s, before Al Gore invented the internet-- it found that when you make these phone calls, you don't have an expectation of privacy with respect to the data regarding who you called and how long you called for.
David Cole (role: against): And they passed a law that forbade the government from getting it without individualized suspicion.

Richard Falkenrath (role: for): So this program, the one that draws your ire so strongly, the bulk acquisition of telephone call records.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): First point: The Supreme Court has held, since the late '70s, that this data, like what number called what number at what time for how long is not privacy information.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Getting it from the government is not a search.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Now, professor Cole and his scholarship on this is against that and thinks the Supreme Court got it wrong.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Nonetheless, the Supreme Court, for 35 years, has held this consistently.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Second, going beyond what is strictly necessary from what the Supreme Court says, the Congress has authorized this provision.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It's called section 215.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It was in the Patriot Act.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It amended the FISA court regulation.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): People on your side of this debate were against it then, and you're still against it now.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): 215 was very controversial then.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It's still controversial now among the same people.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): But finally, you leave out the fact that this program, the bulk acquisition of telephone call records for narrow counterterrorism purposes has been authorized 34 times by 14 different federal judges, who wrote, in writing, they said they would not have authorized it but for the safeguards in place.

Michael German (role: against): And I've seen that done on a personal basis.
Michael German (role: against): This is for preventing terrorism, to the for solving a terrorist bombing.

Michael German (role: against): They don't know where to get information, or they may even already have it and not know it.” Another said, ""More information isn't necessarily better.

David Cole (role: against): The call data program, he said, ""Yes, one.” And it was the one that Mike referred to earlier.
David Cole (role: against): And the member of Congress who was friendly to this, to the program, said, wait a minute, you have cases of violence, right, that you stop, not just transfer of money.
John Donvan (role: mod): Stewart Baker, we've been quoting for quite a few minutes here without letting you speak, so it's-- it's your turn.
Stewart Baker (role: for): I-- I have to say, there's a little confusion here.
Stewart Baker (role: for): And I think I hear Professor Cole saying, oh, no, those are all-- spying on us is fine if you're gathering data about travel reservations or border crossings.
Stewart Baker (role: for): We're opposed to this one program that relates to NSA.
Stewart Baker (role: for): That's the position that we are arguing here.
Stewart Baker (role: for): On the question of whether NSA and its program responds to a very real problem, let's remember how they got started with this program.
Stewart Baker (role: for): What they didn't know is that the al-Qaeda operative was planning the hijacking in the United States.
Stewart Baker (role: for): If they had known months before the attack that somebody was inside the United States at that high rank within al-Qaeda, there would have been an all-points bulletin for that person.
Stewart Baker (role: for): When you have a failure like that, you ask, what can we do to make sure that never happens again?
Stewart Baker (role: for): And I think that's a lesson that is written in blood for the national security agency.
Michael German (role: against): Again, the public record disputes that.
Michael German (role: against): But the CIA wasn't talking to the NSA or the FBI or customs is a totally different issue than whether they needed to collect the information.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 2.0, 'undecided_for': 10.0, 'for_against': 7.0, 'for_for': 16.0, 'undecided_against': 18.0, 'for_undecided': 3.0, 'undecided_undecided': 5.0, 'against_undecided': 1.0, 'against_against': 38.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 9.0, 'for': 29.0, 'against': 62.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 33.0, 'for': 26.0, 'against': 41.0}}",Stewart Baker,for,"A few people here and there, but the NSA did not know because they had no tools to know it, to say, ""Well, if somebody else had done their job perfectly, you wouldn't have needed this program,"" is to say, you know, ""If the world were perfect, we wouldn't need counterterrorism."""

John Donvan (role: mod): Remember how you voted just before the opening round, because we’re going to have you vote immediately after all of the arguments and after round three, and the team whose numbers have changed the most over the course of your two votes in percentage point terms will be declared our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now you’ve heard the opening round.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where out motion is: Spy on Me, I Would Rather be Safe.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's let David Cole respond.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponents are saying it's credible.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponents are saying the safeguards are very credible.

Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It's worth-- There's a few things that \-- neither do Stewart or I.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): We think it's effective in this case.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): And you’ve left out a few facts.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): So this program, the one that draws your ire so strongly, the bulk acquisition of telephone call records.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): First point: The Supreme Court has held, since the late '70s, that this data, like what number called what number at what time for how long is not privacy information.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Getting it from the government is not a search.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Now, professor Cole and his scholarship on this is against that and thinks the Supreme Court got it wrong.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Nonetheless, the Supreme Court, for 35 years, has held this consistently.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Second, going beyond what is strictly necessary from what the Supreme Court says, the Congress has authorized this provision.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It's called section 215.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It was in the Patriot Act.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It amended the FISA court regulation.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): People on your side of this debate were against it then, and you're still against it now.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): 215 was very controversial then.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It's still controversial now among the same people.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): But finally, you leave out the fact that this program, the bulk acquisition of telephone call records for narrow counterterrorism purposes has been authorized 34 times by 14 different federal judges, who wrote, in writing, they said they would not have authorized it but for the safeguards in place.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): And every 90 days, they have to do it again.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right.
David Cole (role: against): Well--
David Cole (role: against): What's that-- the first--
David Cole (role: against): The first thing I'd say is I'm not sure we would be satisfied even if the safeguards were fully credible and followed in every instance.
David Cole (role: against): We're going to collect the data from what happens in your bedroom, but we're not going to look at it until we have a really good reason to look at it.
David Cole (role: against): Go ahead.
David Cole (role: against): To Richard's point about the notion that this information is not protected-- we don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to this information.
John Donvan (role: mod): Just remind people of who Mike Hayden is.
David Cole (role: against): I can get such a portrait of who you are that I don't even need the content.
John Donvan (role: mod): David, but I don't think that I-- I directly heard an answer or an articulated answer to why you don't trust the safeguards that-- you said they're not credible after Richard actually made a pretty good point that the Supreme Court has time and again and legislation-- why don't you find them credible?","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 2.0, 'undecided_for': 10.0, 'for_against': 7.0, 'for_for': 16.0, 'undecided_against': 18.0, 'for_undecided': 3.0, 'undecided_undecided': 5.0, 'against_undecided': 1.0, 'against_against': 38.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 9.0, 'for': 29.0, 'against': 62.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 33.0, 'for': 26.0, 'against': 41.0}}",David Cole,against,"What the Supreme Court found was that in the '70s, before Al Gore invented the internet-- it found that when you make these phone calls, you don't have an expectation of privacy with respect to the data regarding who you called and how long you called for."

Michael German<against>: Senior Policy Counsel, ACLU Washington","Richard Falkenrath (role: for): And now, here's-- do you understand why this data matters and why Mike Hayden would say that we want this information where you have no expectation of right to privacy.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): That is how plots are unraveled.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): They look at the communications pattern, they identify the network, and they can diffuse the plot.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): This is how-- this call record data is how it gets unraveled and stopped.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): And it's not a video camera in the bedroom.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): This data, for very good reasons, the government and the Congress and the court do not hold that you have the same expectations of the right to privacy as to you do in your bedroom.
John Donvan (role: mod): And yet we heard Stewart Baker, your opponent, get up and go through a number of cases that he worked where in fact he has--He clearly argued that the availability of the data after crimes were committed helped track down-- put together how the plot was put together and make some pretty decent arrests.
Michael German (role: against): And I've seen that done on a personal basis.
Michael German (role: against): This is for preventing terrorism, to the for solving a terrorist bombing.
Michael German (role: against): So another I was going to quote.
Michael German (role: against): They don't know where to get information, or they may even already have it and not know it.” Another said, ""More information isn't necessarily better.
Michael German (role: against): And I think the founders did a pretty good job of setting up a system based on reasonable suspicion and probable cause.
Michael German (role: against): Again, there's no transparency.
John Donvan (role: mod): So you you're telling me we don't know whether he's telling the truth.
Michael German (role: against): Because--
Michael German (role: against): No, no.
John Donvan (role: mod): What I'm saying is there's no check to know whether the story is true or not.
David Cole (role: against): What he said was the passenger data program.
David Cole (role: against): The call data program, he said, ""Yes, one.” And it was the one that Mike referred to earlier.
David Cole (role: against): And the member of Congress who was friendly to this, to the program, said, wait a minute, you have cases of violence, right, that you stop, not just transfer of money.
John Donvan (role: mod): Stewart Baker, we've been quoting for quite a few minutes here without letting you speak, so it's-- it's your turn.
Stewart Baker (role: for): I-- I have to say, there's a little confusion here.
Stewart Baker (role: for): And I think I hear Professor Cole saying, oh, no, those are all-- spying on us is fine if you're gathering data about travel reservations or border crossings.
Stewart Baker (role: for): We're opposed to this one program that relates to NSA.
Stewart Baker (role: for): That's the position that we are arguing here.
Stewart Baker (role: for): On the question of whether NSA and its program responds to a very real problem, let's remember how they got started with this program.
Stewart Baker (role: for): What they didn't know is that the al-Qaeda operative was planning the hijacking in the United States.
Stewart Baker (role: for): If they had known months before the attack that somebody was inside the United States at that high rank within al-Qaeda, there would have been an all-points bulletin for that person.
Stewart Baker (role: for): When you have a failure like that, you ask, what can we do to make sure that never happens again?
Stewart Baker (role: for): And I think that's a lesson that is written in blood for the national security agency.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 2.0, 'undecided_for': 10.0, 'for_against': 7.0, 'for_for': 16.0, 'undecided_against': 18.0, 'for_undecided': 3.0, 'undecided_undecided': 5.0, 'against_undecided': 1.0, 'against_against': 38.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 9.0, 'for': 29.0, 'against': 62.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 33.0, 'for': 26.0, 'against': 41.0}}",Michael German,against,"Again, the public record disputes that."

Michael German (role: against): And continually going beyond the scope of the minimization procedures and rules to the extent that in 2011, Judge Bates said it was unconstitutional
Michael German (role: against): And luckily, because Edward Snowden did get so much access to it, and because we’re still benefiting even this week from information that’s coming forward, what has become clearer and clearer is that the FISA court was being-- that the NSA was misrepresenting the program, I’ll say that in the nicest way.
Michael German (role: against): If this data and all this stuff was so protected and so well regulated and so controlled, how would Edward Snowden have gotten so much access to it?
Michael German (role: against): Well, I guess the easy two-word response would be Edward Snowden, right?
John Donvan (role: mod): Or what is your response to their basic argument that maybe it’s not so nice, but it’s safe?
John Donvan (role: mod): You know, there’s a process through which governments need to go in-- or that the government needs to know to go in order to dig more deeply into that pile of data, but Michael German, do you trust in the safeguards?
John Donvan (role: mod): They’re arguing that in fact while the data is there, that there are built in safeguards, and those things are for real.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right, so let me take that to the other side.
Stewart Baker (role: for): Yes, absolutely.
John Donvan (role: mod): So in answer to my question, if the safeguards were not in place, you would have a great deal more concern?
Stewart Baker (role: for): They don’t have any ability to look at people for--
Stewart Baker (role: for): To make it much more like the rules that apply to ordinary searches by law enforcement, which is you have a suspicion, and you ask a question about the person or the-- in this case, the phone number that you have a suspicion about.
Stewart Baker (role: for): It’s set up a whole set of rules, court enforced, aggressively audited, limited number of people who can get access to this data, and clear rules for when they can do it.
Stewart Baker (role: for): That is to say the government has the data, but just because it has it doesn’t mean it’s allowed to look at it.
Stewart Baker (role: for): The difficulty here is-- or the protections here are built in to the back end of the system.
Stewart Baker (role: for): There’s no doubt that when the government collects data, everybody in the democracy ought to be concerned and want to make sure that it is handled in as privacy-protected a fashion as possible, consistent with actually having it be effective.
John Donvan (role: mod): Where is your line, Stewart Baker, on just how willing to be spied on you are?
John Donvan (role: mod): It’s just not enough to count, and I want to know why that is.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now you-- your side, you’re not denying the fact that to some degree there is a compromise of privacy.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go to the side that’s arguing for this motion, that’s more comfortable with the surveillance programs that are in place, and say to you that your opponents have made the argument that-- well, one of them in particular, he said this program that the NSA conducted really affronted his sense of privacy, just in a very basic way.
John Donvan (role: mod): The failure to be transparent goes too far, and that in any case, the system would be flooded with so much data in such a situation that it actually becomes counterproductive to have that information on citizens who have done nothing wrong.
John Donvan (role: mod): The violation of privacy goes too far.
John Donvan (role: mod): They’re saying yes, there are threats and there does need to be surveillance, but that basically a government that’s able to fish in this sea of data is a government that’s exceeding its position in democratic society.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Michael German and David Cole, they’re arguing against this motion, Spy on Me, I’d Rather be Safe.
John Donvan (role: mod): Those safeguards are legally sanctioned and the result of years and years of concern about how to incorporate privacy into the activities-- respect for privacy into the activities of the intelligence community.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team that’s arguing for this motion, Richard Falkenrath and Stewart Baker, make the argument that there are no simple answers to this; yes, there is a conflict between privacy and security, but that on the whole the mass surveillance programs such as were exposed in 2013 regarding the NSA and phone records and Verizon-- that by and large that those programs work, that they are protected by safeguards.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing out on this motion: Spy on My, I’d Rather be Safe.
John Donvan (role: mod): Round two is where the debaters address one and another directly and answer questions from me and from you, our live audience here in Washington, DC.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): Remember how you voted just before the opening round, because we’re going to have you vote immediately after all of the arguments and after round three, and the team whose numbers have changed the most over the course of your two votes in percentage point terms will be declared our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now you’ve heard the opening round.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where out motion is: Spy on Me, I Would Rather be Safe.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's let David Cole respond.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponents are saying it's credible.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponents are saying the safeguards are very credible.
David Cole (role: against): Suppose the government said, ""We're going to put a video camera in each one of your bedrooms.
David Cole (role: against): Would we say, ""Okay, that's fine.
David Cole (role: against): Put the video camera in every one of our--"" so back end safeguards don't answer all of the concerns.
David Cole (role: against): Mike Hayden has said, if they can get all the--
David Cole (role: against): Mike Hayden, the former head of NSA, CIA, has said, “if I can get all of that phone data about who you've called over a period of time, I don't need to listen to what you're saying.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 2.0, 'undecided_for': 10.0, 'for_against': 7.0, 'for_for': 16.0, 'undecided_against': 18.0, 'for_undecided': 3.0, 'undecided_undecided': 5.0, 'against_undecided': 1.0, 'against_against': 38.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 9.0, 'for': 29.0, 'against': 62.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 33.0, 'for': 26.0, 'against': 41.0}}",David Cole,against,This stuff is more private than the content itself.”

John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
Stewart Baker (role: for): So that was done quite consciously because everyone at NSA and in the government believed that the right answer was not to look at data without some reason to believe that the person that you're looking at is engaged in suspicious activity.
Stewart Baker (role: for): The reason that they gathered it first was because it was not practical to leave it where it was.
John Donvan (role: mod): Would someone like to respond?
John Donvan (role: mod): Michael German.
Michael German (role: against): If we know-- and there's studies to show this-- if we know we're under surveillance, our behavior changes, right?
Michael German (role: against): But even with the limited number of searches, they go three hops.
Michael German (role: against): And then that-- it's like a big scoop that goes into this database, pulls out all those numbers which could rise into the millions--
Stewart Baker (role: for): They put in 300, they brought out 500, and they gave 500 numbers to the FBI.
Michael German (role: against): They said they go three hops out, so if you only talked to two people, perhaps five--
Stewart Baker (role: for): When they find the suspicious numbers, they take it to the FBI.
John Donvan (role: mod): I thought I saw a hand.
David Cole (role: against): That just says how many numbers they--

Michael German<against>: Senior Policy Counsel, ACLU Washington","Richard Falkenrath (role: for): We talked to another person, who is in the audience, and was the coordinator of this.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): We talked to the coordinator of this debate, who then put us together, right?
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): They find out about one perp.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): So imagine this was not a debate but a bombing.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): And it's why it matters.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): That is-- that is not a fair comparison, and I think you know it.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me bring in Michael German and move the topic a little bit to the issue of practicality, because Michael, you made the case in your opening statement against this motion, ""Spy on me, I'd rather be safe.” You made the case that the flood of data is actually-- it's overload, that it can't be used.
Michael German (role: against): So there's no doubt the FBI has tremendous investigative skills that can be put to place once you know something bad has happened.
Michael German (role: against): But what we're talking about-- first of all, it was sold as a preventive measure.
Michael German (role: against): So you know, I think that the analysts at the NCTC really say it all.
Michael German (role: against): ""There are so many databases, people don't even know what buttons to push.
Michael German (role: against): Better information is better.” So that's what we have to focus on, how-- how do we let law enforcement have the tools it needs to get the bad guys without impacting the rights of the rest of us?
John Donvan (role: mod): But does that mean you're just dismissing the achievements that your opponent laid out, where in fact the data was used to--
Michael German (role: against): There have been these cases that they say these were solved with this program--
Michael German (role: against): Right.
John Donvan (role: mod): Not that you're-- and I want to make clear--
John Donvan (role: mod): --that you're not calling-- accusing him of dishonesty.
David Cole (role: against): and it's also worth noting that Stewart did not say that the NSA data mining program solved any of these.
David Cole (role: against): When the NSA was asked, point blank, by Congress, and by a friendly member of Congress, can you tell us some terrorist plots that you've stopped by virtue of the NSA data mining program?
David Cole (role: against): It was about an $8,000 transmission.
David Cole (role: against): And the NSA guy had to say, all right, actually, no.
Stewart Baker (role: for): Yeah.
Stewart Baker (role: for): I hear Mike German saying, you know, all of these data collection programs are bad.
Stewart Baker (role: for): All of that data isn't the kind of spying on us that we're opposed to.
Stewart Baker (role: for): And I think that suggests that they really don't have the courage of their convictions, that information that is available to third parties should be used for security purposes.
Stewart Baker (role: for): And I think we've done a good job.
Stewart Baker (role: for): In the months before 9/11, NSA was listening to communications in Yemen, and they heard calls from an al-Qaeda operative.
Stewart Baker (role: for): And those calls were coming from inside the United States, because they had no way to look inside the United States to see where these calls were coming from.
Stewart Baker (role: for): They would have found him, and probably the attack would not have occurred.
Stewart Baker (role: for): And this program responds in part to that concern.

Richard Falkenrath (role: for): We think it's effective in this case.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): And you’ve left out a few facts.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): So this program, the one that draws your ire so strongly, the bulk acquisition of telephone call records.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): First point: The Supreme Court has held, since the late '70s, that this data, like what number called what number at what time for how long is not privacy information.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Getting it from the government is not a search.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Now, professor Cole and his scholarship on this is against that and thinks the Supreme Court got it wrong.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Nonetheless, the Supreme Court, for 35 years, has held this consistently.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): Second, going beyond what is strictly necessary from what the Supreme Court says, the Congress has authorized this provision.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It's called section 215.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It was in the Patriot Act.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It amended the FISA court regulation.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): People on your side of this debate were against it then, and you're still against it now.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): 215 was very controversial then.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): It's still controversial now among the same people.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): But finally, you leave out the fact that this program, the bulk acquisition of telephone call records for narrow counterterrorism purposes has been authorized 34 times by 14 different federal judges, who wrote, in writing, they said they would not have authorized it but for the safeguards in place.
Richard Falkenrath (role: for): And every 90 days, they have to do it again.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right.
David Cole (role: against): Well--
David Cole (role: against): What's that-- the first--
David Cole (role: against): The first thing I'd say is I'm not sure we would be satisfied even if the safeguards were fully credible and followed in every instance.
David Cole (role: against): We're going to collect the data from what happens in your bedroom, but we're not going to look at it until we have a really good reason to look at it.
David Cole (role: against): Go ahead.
David Cole (role: against): To Richard's point about the notion that this information is not protected-- we don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to this information.
John Donvan (role: mod): Just remind people of who Mike Hayden is.
David Cole (role: against): I can get such a portrait of who you are that I don't even need the content.
John Donvan (role: mod): David, but I don't think that I-- I directly heard an answer or an articulated answer to why you don't trust the safeguards that-- you said they're not credible after Richard actually made a pretty good point that the Supreme Court has time and again and legislation-- why don't you find them credible?

John Donvan (role: mod): The failure to be transparent goes too far, and that in any case, the system would be flooded with so much data in such a situation that it actually becomes counterproductive to have that information on citizens who have done nothing wrong.
John Donvan (role: mod): The violation of privacy goes too far.
John Donvan (role: mod): They’re saying yes, there are threats and there does need to be surveillance, but that basically a government that’s able to fish in this sea of data is a government that’s exceeding its position in democratic society.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Michael German and David Cole, they’re arguing against this motion, Spy on Me, I’d Rather be Safe.
John Donvan (role: mod): Those safeguards are legally sanctioned and the result of years and years of concern about how to incorporate privacy into the activities-- respect for privacy into the activities of the intelligence community.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team that’s arguing for this motion, Richard Falkenrath and Stewart Baker, make the argument that there are no simple answers to this; yes, there is a conflict between privacy and security, but that on the whole the mass surveillance programs such as were exposed in 2013 regarding the NSA and phone records and Verizon-- that by and large that those programs work, that they are protected by safeguards.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing out on this motion: Spy on My, I’d Rather be Safe.
John Donvan (role: mod): Round two is where the debaters address one and another directly and answer questions from me and from you, our live audience here in Washington, DC.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): Remember how you voted just before the opening round, because we’re going to have you vote immediately after all of the arguments and after round three, and the team whose numbers have changed the most over the course of your two votes in percentage point terms will be declared our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now you’ve heard the opening round.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where out motion is: Spy on Me, I Would Rather be Safe.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's let David Cole respond.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponents are saying it's credible.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponents are saying the safeguards are very credible.
David Cole (role: against): Suppose the government said, ""We're going to put a video camera in each one of your bedrooms.
David Cole (role: against): Would we say, ""Okay, that's fine.
David Cole (role: against): Put the video camera in every one of our--"" so back end safeguards don't answer all of the concerns.

David Cole (role: against): Mike Hayden, the former head of NSA, CIA, has said, “if I can get all of that phone data about who you've called over a period of time, I don't need to listen to what you're saying.

Michael German (role: against): So there's no doubt the FBI has tremendous investigative skills that can be put to place once you know something bad has happened.
Michael German (role: against): But what we're talking about-- first of all, it was sold as a preventive measure.
Michael German (role: against): So you know, I think that the analysts at the NCTC really say it all.
Michael German (role: against): ""There are so many databases, people don't even know what buttons to push.
Michael German (role: against): Better information is better.” So that's what we have to focus on, how-- how do we let law enforcement have the tools it needs to get the bad guys without impacting the rights of the rest of us?

Michael German (role: against): There have been these cases that they say these were solved with this program--
Michael German (role: against): Right.
John Donvan (role: mod): Not that you're-- and I want to make clear--
John Donvan (role: mod): --that you're not calling-- accusing him of dishonesty.
David Cole (role: against): and it's also worth noting that Stewart did not say that the NSA data mining program solved any of these.
David Cole (role: against): When the NSA was asked, point blank, by Congress, and by a friendly member of Congress, can you tell us some terrorist plots that you've stopped by virtue of the NSA data mining program?
David Cole (role: against): It was about an $8,000 transmission.
David Cole (role: against): And the NSA guy had to say, all right, actually, no.
Stewart Baker (role: for): Yeah.
Stewart Baker (role: for): I hear Mike German saying, you know, all of these data collection programs are bad.
Stewart Baker (role: for): All of that data isn't the kind of spying on us that we're opposed to.
Stewart Baker (role: for): And I think that suggests that they really don't have the courage of their convictions, that information that is available to third parties should be used for security purposes.
Stewart Baker (role: for): And I think we've done a good job.
Stewart Baker (role: for): In the months before 9/11, NSA was listening to communications in Yemen, and they heard calls from an al-Qaeda operative.
Stewart Baker (role: for): And those calls were coming from inside the United States, because they had no way to look inside the United States to see where these calls were coming from.
Stewart Baker (role: for): They would have found him, and probably the attack would not have occurred.
Stewart Baker (role: for): And this program responds in part to that concern.

John Donvan (role: mod): And, given that hypothetical, if the problems that you specify with the death penalty were fixed, would that change your position on the justice of the death penalty?
John Donvan (role: mod): The things that you're talking about could be fixed.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go to the team that's arguing to abolish the death penalty and point out that to some degree what your opponents are saying is that the policy is not perfect but could be perfected.
John Donvan (role: mod): They disagree with one another on whether deterrence is the issue or not, but they make the argument that the data on deterrence is murky as well as the data on racial bias, they say, is murky, and life without parole is described as not very punishing.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Kent Scheidegger and Robert Blecker, argue that the system is not perfect but it's not very broken, ""Some people deserve to die,"" they say, that just desserts are appropriate, and that the death penalty serves a very real, moral, and social purpose.
John Donvan (role: mod): They argue also that there is an alternative punishment, which would be life without parole.
John Donvan (role: mod): It-- factors like wealth, location, geography, quality of legal representation come into play.
John Donvan (role: mod): It's too arbitrary.
John Donvan (role: mod): Too many examples of racial bias in execution of the policy.
John Donvan (role: mod): We heard them argue that the death penalty represents a broken policy that fails to protect public safety, that undermines the fair administration of justice.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing for the motion, to abolish, Barry Scheck and Diann Rust-Tierney.
John Donvan (role: mod): The motion, again, is, ""Abolish the Death Penalty.""
John Donvan (role: mod): In round two, the debaters address one another directly, and they take questions from me and from you, our live audience here in New York.
John Donvan (role: mod): Debate, where our motion is, ""Abolish the Death Penalty.""

John Donvan (role: mod): Debate, where our motion is, ""Abolish the Death Penalty.""
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S.
Barry Scheck (role: for): I'm a law professor.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
Barry Scheck (role: for): You know, if you're making a public policy argument and you're living just as the attorney general in Virginia said, in a fairly land, where you actually believe that you're going to eliminate the risk of executing innocent people, which you didn't mention, John, is a major cost of the death penalty, which we now know is much greater than we ever did before.
Barry Scheck (role: for): DNA testing obviously has proven that, but in 2009 the National Academy of Sciences has just indicated in a groundbreaking report that fingerprints, ballistics, bite mark evidence, pattern evidence, all kinds of other evidence that we used to rely on think we're so sure are in doubt and we're now trying to get all these resources together to do basic applied research and make it reliable.
John Donvan (role: mod): Do you think that's true and if so does that concern you seriously?
Robert Blecker (role: against): That is fundamentally a retributive program.
Robert Blecker (role: against): You say 100 percent certainty.
Robert Blecker (role: against): The fact is we trust our lives constantly.
Robert Blecker (role: against): Surely if I'm willing to take an infinitesimal risk for those I love for the sake of convenience, I'm willing to take that same kind of risk for those I detest for the sake of something much more sacred, which is justice.
Robert Blecker (role: against): I'd love to talk about how it can be refined and improved.
Robert Blecker (role: against): Some will admit and have admitted to me yes, people do deserve to die, I just don't trust the government to do it.
Robert Blecker (role: against): And so when you ask the question you asked, you're using the entering which to split the ranks of the abolitionists.
Barry Scheck (role: for): That's-- I'll admit I don't trust the government to get it right.
Robert Blecker (role: against): But do people deserve to die, Barry?
Robert Blecker (role: against): Do people deserve to die?

Robert Blecker (role: against): Washington, D.C., did not, and Washington, D.C., had a much higher murder rate.
Robert Blecker (role: against): Well, in fact, one of them told me about a situation in which he broke into the house of a drug dealer expecting many keys of coke and found many keys of heroin.
Robert Blecker (role: against): And I asked him, ""Why?
Robert Blecker (role: against): He said, ""Well, when I was a child, I used to look through the window of the D.C. jail and look at the electric chair, and when I was on Virginia's penitentiary, I used to sweep the hall and look at the electric chair.

Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): You said, ""It's equivocal, but we should keep going forward,"" and that's really the public policy question.
John Donvan (role: mod): And the example he gave was on the race question, where he said, if I have this right, Kent, that at one time the argument was that most of the convicts facing-- on death row were disproportionately African-American, but that the argument, failing data confirmation, that you move the argument to ""Most of the victims are white,"" and that, that's a little bit of a dance.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): I wish I had the power to move goal posts the way Kent was talking about, but we don't do that.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): What I see is sort of Kent looking selectively at the evidence.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): The core issue is that the death penalty values some lives more than others.

John Donvan (role: mod): So, I'd like you to respond both to his point that you're moving the goalpost and just to go to the point itself.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): The facts are the same.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): The case has always been that the death penalty actually tracks our history of racial apartheid when it comes to criminal justice, that the death penalty when we had slave codes actually was meted out based on the race of the victim and the race of the defendant, and even though the slave codes and-- we've made some progress, the-- the process-- the system still works the same way.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): And when it comes to the good that our opponents are saying the death penalty offers, that good is only used when the victim is white, because that's where the system currently sees the value lying.

John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): I'll let you finish and then bring it to Kent.

Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): There was a recent study that just came out that looked at death sentences from 1976 to 2013, and what that study found was two things, first, that the race of victim discrimination continued, that the least likely-- as I said earlier, the least likely victim for whom the death penalty is sought will be an African-American man even though African-American men are the most likely to be the victims of homicide.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): One other point, prosecutors-- every study-- there's been over 200 studies over 40 years-- every study has found that prosecutors seek the death penalty for crimes against white victims more frequently than other victims.

Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): And what we're talking about in terms of years of study is the same science that we use to look at implicit bias generally.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): It's the same science that we've used to determine that women are not receiving equal pay.

John Donvan (role: mod): Go ahead, Robert Blecker.
Robert Blecker (role: against): And that's not the way it's administered.
Robert Blecker (role: against): That is to say, because felony murder is the most common aggravator, and robbery murders put more people on death row than any other aggravator, and because robbery is an economic crime and correlates with race, that creates the disparity in terms of percentage of population of population of those who are on death row, if you eliminate the robber aggravator from felony murder as a death penalty aggravator you eliminate the racially disparage effect and the other place that it occurs is the place that nobody wants to talk about, but that I became aware of.

Robert Blecker (role: against): You know, just to give you an example of that, the Gallup Poll from the-- not the latest one, the one before that-- had 60 percent of the American people supporting the death penalty, answering the standard question which they've been asking since 1936.

Kent Scheidegger (role: against): You can get the result you want.
Kent Scheidegger (role: against): And I do want to mention the Baldus study from Georgia, that study went to trial in Federal District Court, and the finding of the Federal District Court was that Baldus's study did not, in fact, prove what he said it proved.
Robert Blecker (role: against): Yeah, I want to dig down and talk about the meaning of this race of victim effect, if it's real, and I believe it is real.
Robert Blecker (role: against): And I explored this issue in depth.
Robert Blecker (role: against): That's not true.
Robert Blecker (role: against): Most killings are same-race killings, whites on whites, blacks on blacks.
Robert Blecker (role: against): The odds of picking a jury that'll go death is greater in white jurisdictions, although there is substantial support for the death penalty in a black-- in black communities, it's less than half.
Robert Blecker (role: against): So, what does it really mean?

Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): The facts are the same.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): The case has always been that the death penalty actually tracks our history of racial apartheid when it comes to criminal justice, that the death penalty when we had slave codes actually was meted out based on the race of the victim and the race of the defendant, and even though the slave codes and-- we've made some progress, the-- the process-- the system still works the same way.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): And when it comes to the good that our opponents are saying the death penalty offers, that good is only used when the victim is white, because that's where the system currently sees the value lying.

John Donvan (role: mod): And, given that hypothetical, if the problems that you specify with the death penalty were fixed, would that change your position on the justice of the death penalty?
John Donvan (role: mod): The things that you're talking about could be fixed.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go to the team that's arguing to abolish the death penalty and point out that to some degree what your opponents are saying is that the policy is not perfect but could be perfected.
John Donvan (role: mod): They disagree with one another on whether deterrence is the issue or not, but they make the argument that the data on deterrence is murky as well as the data on racial bias, they say, is murky, and life without parole is described as not very punishing.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Kent Scheidegger and Robert Blecker, argue that the system is not perfect but it's not very broken, ""Some people deserve to die,"" they say, that just desserts are appropriate, and that the death penalty serves a very real, moral, and social purpose.
John Donvan (role: mod): They argue also that there is an alternative punishment, which would be life without parole.
John Donvan (role: mod): It-- factors like wealth, location, geography, quality of legal representation come into play.
John Donvan (role: mod): It's too arbitrary.
John Donvan (role: mod): Too many examples of racial bias in execution of the policy.

Barry Scheck (role: for): DNA testing obviously has proven that, but in 2009 the National Academy of Sciences has just indicated in a groundbreaking report that fingerprints, ballistics, bite mark evidence, pattern evidence, all kinds of other evidence that we used to rely on think we're so sure are in doubt and we're now trying to get all these resources together to do basic applied research and make it reliable.

Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): I would just say, you know, we're talking as if we're-- the only thing out there is the death penalty.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): The vast majority of cases that are resolved have justice because people are serving long prison sentences, including life without parole.

John Donvan (role: mod): Let's let Diann speak.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): The question is not-- because many of the people that were surveyed did support the death penalty in theory, but when they were asked from their position of having to manage law enforcement resources and from their experience about what they thought it needed to take-- what it took to make the community safer, they made a choice that said that the death penalty, among all the things that we could have, is the least useful thing that we would need.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): The question is whether when you have to make tough choices about resources, whether this is the thing that's going to get the result.
Robert Blecker (role: against): Oh, so I don't get to answer that.
Robert Blecker (role: against): I wanted to respond to that in terms of management and resources, but-- and why police chiefs aren't the right people to-- there's an analogy inside the prison about why corrections officers are the last people to ask also about the death penalty, because for them it's a management question and it's much easier to manage without it than it is to manage with it.
Robert Blecker (role: against): The states are increasingly abolishing the death penalty in my view because they are abetted by the media, which is overwhelmingly anti-death penalty, overwhelmingly, and which skews the perspective on it.
Robert Blecker (role: against): The headlines were, ""Death Penalty Support a 40-Year Low.""

John Donvan (role: mod): Diann, I want to take to you a point that I believe I understood Kent to make, which was that the-- that your side, the abolitionist's side, moves arguments when the data fails your first arguments.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, I'd like you to respond both to his point that you're moving the goalpost and just to go to the point itself.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): The facts are the same.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): The case has always been that the death penalty actually tracks our history of racial apartheid when it comes to criminal justice, that the death penalty when we had slave codes actually was meted out based on the race of the victim and the race of the defendant, and even though the slave codes and-- we've made some progress, the-- the process-- the system still works the same way.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): And when it comes to the good that our opponents are saying the death penalty offers, that good is only used when the victim is white, because that's where the system currently sees the value lying.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): And the data is there.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): I'll let you finish and then bring it to Kent.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): Well, first of all-- --finish.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): There was a recent study that just came out that looked at death sentences from 1976 to 2013, and what that study found was two things, first, that the race of victim discrimination continued, that the least likely-- as I said earlier, the least likely victim for whom the death penalty is sought will be an African-American man even though African-American men are the most likely to be the victims of homicide.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): One other point, prosecutors-- every study-- there's been over 200 studies over 40 years-- every study has found that prosecutors seek the death penalty for crimes against white victims more frequently than other victims.
Kent Scheidegger (role: against): Okay.
Kent Scheidegger (role: against): Well, first of all, I'm very glad to hear that we are agreed that seeking the death penalty constitutes honoring the life of the victim.

Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): The question is do we do things that don't add up to a real product and we've yet to hear.
John Donvan (role: mod): Diann, why don't you feel the abstract question is relevant?
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): And when you have a public policy decision to make you look at does this thing that we're doing actually produce what it's supposed to?
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): And our opponents concede that this thing is broken.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): The point is it's broken.
John Donvan (role: mod): Kent Scheidegger, just a little bit more on the abstractness of this issue.
Kent Scheidegger (role: against): Yeah.
John Donvan (role: mod): For example, the question that maybe some people do deserve to die does not belong in this conversation because we're talking about a policy.
Kent Scheidegger (role: against): I believe that both the retributive and the utilitarian aspects have to be considered.
Barry Scheck (role: for): I should add one thing on the-- I don't want to be perceived as ducking the moral question.
Barry Scheck (role: for): You know, the Pope-- in the corner with the Pope and others on that question, but when you're debating a public policy issue about something like this that doesn't work and is causing incredible suffering for the wrongly convicted, even for many families of murder victims that don't find closure in this process and go through it, some do, I just, you know, nobody wants to say that the moral question is irrelevant, but it is a factor to be weighed.

John Donvan (role: mod): Diann.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's let Diann speak.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): The question is not-- because many of the people that were surveyed did support the death penalty in theory, but when they were asked from their position of having to manage law enforcement resources and from their experience about what they thought it needed to take-- what it took to make the community safer, they made a choice that said that the death penalty, among all the things that we could have, is the least useful thing that we would need.
Diann Rust-Tierney (role: for): The question is whether when you have to make tough choices about resources, whether this is the thing that's going to get the result.
Robert Blecker (role: against): Oh, so I don't get to answer that.
Robert Blecker (role: against): I wanted to respond to that in terms of management and resources, but-- and why police chiefs aren't the right people to-- there's an analogy inside the prison about why corrections officers are the last people to ask also about the death penalty, because for them it's a management question and it's much easier to manage without it than it is to manage with it.
Robert Blecker (role: against): The states are increasingly abolishing the death penalty in my view because they are abetted by the media, which is overwhelmingly anti-death penalty, overwhelmingly, and which skews the perspective on it.

Karl Rove<against>: Fox News Contributor","John Donvan (role: mod): Simon Jenkins, I want to bring you into the conversation.
John Donvan (role: mod): With Barack Obama now taking over, does the fact that he has this terrible image with which to compare himself, give him a boost, or does the fact that American leadership have been so diminished, respect for America has been so diminished, give him a terrible starting point?
Simon Jenkins (role: for): 9/11 is the starting point of almost everything that we’ve been talking about.
Simon Jenkins (role: for): So, this is not something peculiar to America.
Simon Jenkins (role: for): I'm a libertarian, and I feel that was, I’ve always felt that was simply unnecessary, the reaction was an overreaction.
Simon Jenkins (role: for): We’ve done what they wanted us to do, which was restrict our liberties, curb our liberties, behave in a certain way towards other States and other peoples that we would not normally have done before.
John Donvan (role: mod): But I heard Bill Kristol saying, and Bill, let me bring you into this, I’ve heard you say that, when it comes to terrorism, rather than playing the terrorist’s game, that the President has succeeded in putting the terrorists on the run, which is why 9/11 was the only incident in this city.
John Donvan (role: mod): Bill Kristol.
William Kristol (role: against): Al Qaeda has been a losing proposition for the last several years.
William Kristol (role: against): But I think Bush has done a pretty good, well, a very good job of making terror a losing proposition, which is the most important thing he could have done, taken away their momentum, which again, if we had not gone into Iraq, and if we had lost in Iraq, that would have been the single most disastrous result.
William Kristol (role: against): But I just don’t buy this premise that we’ve radically curved civil liberties.
William Kristol (role: against): He’s been much more solicitous of civil liberties than, if I might say, John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were during, and Richard Nixon were, during Vietnam.
William Kristol (role: against): There were a couple of over-reactions which the Bush administration itself walked back, Jack Goldsmith and Attorney General Mukasey have, I think, corrected some controversial interpretations that probably went too far—
William Kristol (role: against): Yeah.
John Donvan (role: mod): Jacob Weisberg.
William Kristol (role: against): That's not true.
William Kristol (role: against): They, he changed the actual Office of Legal Counsel policy, and Attorney General Mukasey is leaving the Bush legal program intact, and I—
William Kristol (role: against): It’s totally defensible, and it will not be changed much by Barack Obama.
Jacob Weisberg (role: for): But the point is you--I'm amazed by--I appreciate how open minded you are about some of these issues.
Jacob Weisberg (role: for): Closing Guantanamo is no big deal, we have them here, we have them there.

William Kristol (role: against): Alito, sixty-one appointments to Federal courts.
William Kristol (role: against): He made a couple of mistakes, I think, in his appointments, out of excessive loyalty, perhaps with Alberto Gonzales, but the fact is, Ashcroft was a serious Attorney General, and then he brought in Mukasey, and he’s leaving an intact and functioning legal system which we can be proud of given the threats we’re facing.
Simon Jenkins (role: for): What I think is extraordinary to people abroad, is that those of us who are enthusiasts for America and American liberties cannot see why you needed to do these things.

William Kristol (role: against): I mean, Lyndon Johnson probably made the worst mistake, perhaps, of the last fifty years, with Vietnam, but he also deserves a huge amount of credit, I think, and I’ll say this as a conservative and a Republican, some of what he did in terms of, certainly, civil rights, and I would say something like Medicare.
William Kristol (role: against): I do think, at the same time, personal, corruption of the political system for political, of the judicial system, and of the governmental system for political ends, clearly Nixon.
William Kristol (role: against): So, the seventies was a bad decade, in my opinion, for American presidents, and for America, and for the world.

William Kristol (role: against): And the biggest, and the biggest spending item is, are two things, the tax cuts, we can debate economic policy, but I think an awful lot of people think especially 2003 tax cuts were sensible and ended up producing, actually, a lot of revenue.

John Donvan (role: mod): But I would like to ask a question of the side that is arguing against the motion, Katrina, you said that there is no Plan B, but what I heard from the other side sounded like, Plan C, D, E, F, G, all the way through Z, what— why do you feel that the argument particularly that Jim VandeHei made that there are plenty of already evident… forms of real, legitimate replacement, good journalism happening, why don’t you take those seriously as actually stepping up and filling the gap that you say is absent without a Plan B.
John Donvan (role: mod): Something that is spontaneous, fresh, and real, will always work best.
John Donvan (role: mod): And as you ponder your questions I’ll once again ask you to think in terms of real questions and to think in terms of something that’s very brief, and if you have to write it on a piece of paper it’s probably not what you want to do.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now we’re—now we’re moving on to Round 2, this is our middle round in which the debaters address each other directly, and we will also take questions from you in the audience.
John Donvan (role: mod): That is where things started, you will vote again at the conclusion to pick our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): Before the debate 25 percent were for the motion, 50 percent against the motion, and 25 percent undecided.
John Donvan (role: mod): Here are the preliminary results.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes Round 1 of this Intelligence Squared debate where the motion is, “Good riddance to the mainstream media.” And I’ve now received the results of the preliminary vote, just to remind you and to remind listeners and viewers, our live audience voted before the debate began, their positions on our motion, “Good riddance to the mainstream media.” They will vote again at the end of the debate and the team that changes the most minds over the course of the debate will be declared our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): But Katrina, let him—
John Donvan (role: mod): —Katrina, Katrina—
John Donvan (role: mod): Katrina, please let him speak.
Michael Wolff (role: for): Now in your—everything you’ve said is incredibly noble, and it’s good, I wish it would happen, but it’s not the media business.
Michael Wolff (role: for): That you do something else.

Bret Stephens (role: against): I think Paul and I would agree that we do not want-- the American government does not want Israel to attack Iran in the event that Iran or the Israelis perceive that Iran is approaching a nuclear capability, some point of no return.
Bret Stephens (role: against): It tells them that America's promise that it will not allow Iran to get nuclear weapons is a totally hollow promise that they cannot trust.
Bret Stephens (role: against): You can ask the Israeli defense minister who is on record as saying this.
Bret Stephens (role: against): Why?
Bret Stephens (role: against): Same story with the Saudis.
Bret Stephens (role: against): The Saudis don't trust us anymore, which is why John Kerry had to go on bended knee to Riyadh a few weeks ago to say, ""No, this time we're actually serious.""
Aaron David Miller (role: for): We've spent the-- and, again, I haven't seen a piece of classified information since 2003, so what I'm about to say is my view-- we've spent the last several years trying to preempt the Israelis from striking Iran prematurely.

Aaron David Miller (role: for): One is another consequential attack on the homeland-- I'm not talking about a lone wolf inspired attack, I'm talking about directed attack that leads to scores of American casualties, regardless of his actions now-- and the second, which three administrations have now committed themselves to, is Iran's crossing the threshold to weaponize--

John Donvan (role: mod): Can you respond to that?
Paul Pillar (role: for): That is simply not the case, and there's academic research on this, that it's not the way that other governments think or perceive us.
Paul Pillar (role: for): Would we say, ""Oh, they're a bunch of weak-kneed lily-livered weaklings, and they're not going to stick up for their vital interests""?
Paul Pillar (role: for): We would assume they would, and that's the same thing with us.
Bret Stephens (role: against): Look, what Paul said is just simply manifestly untrue.
Bret Stephens (role: against): But when we show, when we tell the Israelis, when we announce that we have a red line in Syria, and then we erase that red line and the president goes before the cameras and says, ""Oh, I never said, 'red line,' the world had a red line, it was someone else's red line, and, by the way, I have this interesting diplomatic gambit that I've worked out with Sergey Lavrov,” what does that tell decision makers in Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv?
Bret Stephens (role: against): And you don't have to take my word for it.
Bret Stephens (role: against): So we have this issue of credibility that Paul has just raised and dismissed-- we have exponentially increased the chance that Israel will become a foreign policy freelancer in what is perhaps the most fraught situation in the Middle East.

Paul Pillar (role: for): The one substantive point I'd add, John, is that-- is this issue of political will, because ultimately, the fate of this group certainly in Iraq, but also in Syria, is going to depend on the politics and the capital-- and we've had some encouraging signs in Baghdad-- but further political evolution so that Iraqi Sunnis know that they've got a future in an Iraq that is not dominated by ISIS.

Paul Pillar (role: for): There was no such thing as ISIS or a forerunner of it before we invaded Iraq.

Paul Pillar (role: for): The one substantive point I'd add, John, is that-- is this issue of political will, because ultimately, the fate of this group certainly in Iraq, but also in Syria, is going to depend on the politics and the capital-- and we've had some encouraging signs in Baghdad-- but further political evolution so that Iraqi Sunnis know that they've got a future in an Iraq that is not dominated by ISIS.

John Donvan (role: mod): Paul Pillar, very good argument made by your opponents about our credibility and which was put up in opposition to your saying that we make enemies by getting in there.
John Donvan (role: mod): Can you respond to that?
Paul Pillar (role: for): That is simply not the case, and there's academic research on this, that it's not the way that other governments think or perceive us.
Paul Pillar (role: for): Would we say, ""Oh, they're a bunch of weak-kneed lily-livered weaklings, and they're not going to stick up for their vital interests""?
Paul Pillar (role: for): We would assume they would, and that's the same thing with us.
Bret Stephens (role: against): Look, what Paul said is just simply manifestly untrue.
Bret Stephens (role: against): But when we show, when we tell the Israelis, when we announce that we have a red line in Syria, and then we erase that red line and the president goes before the cameras and says, ""Oh, I never said, 'red line,' the world had a red line, it was someone else's red line, and, by the way, I have this interesting diplomatic gambit that I've worked out with Sergey Lavrov,” what does that tell decision makers in Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv?
Bret Stephens (role: against): And you don't have to take my word for it.
Bret Stephens (role: against): So we have this issue of credibility that Paul has just raised and dismissed-- we have exponentially increased the chance that Israel will become a foreign policy freelancer in what is perhaps the most fraught situation in the Middle East.
Bret Stephens (role: against): Because they don't trust the Americans.
Bret Stephens (role: against): We used to have a close defense alliance with the Saudis.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay, point made, and I want to take it to Aaron David Miller.
Aaron David Miller (role: for): On the assumption that negotiations and or sanctions, some combination of the two would retard, ultimately undermine Iran's pursuit of a nuclear weapons capacity-- forget the weapon itself, just the threshold capacity-- we've make commitments to the Israelis based on the assumption that if they stay their hand and Iran moves to weaponize, we will do this because we can do it better, we can do it more comprehensively and more definitively.

Michael Doran (role: against): The problem that-- the current campaign will set them back, clearly, and put them on the back seat, but it's impossible to win with this campaign because what we have from Baghdad to Damascus, Baghdad to Beirut, is a problem of Sunni society.
Michael Doran (role: against): And our Air Force is coming in and by intention or by accident, is changing the balance of power on the ground in favor of the Shiites against the Sunnis, which is not going to give us the ability to root out ISIS.

Paul Pillar (role: for): The one substantive point I'd add, John, is that-- is this issue of political will, because ultimately, the fate of this group certainly in Iraq, but also in Syria, is going to depend on the politics and the capital-- and we've had some encouraging signs in Baghdad-- but further political evolution so that Iraqi Sunnis know that they've got a future in an Iraq that is not dominated by ISIS.

Michael Doran (role: against): We would like to have Turkey, one of the most important countries there, go and do things in Syria.
Michael Doran (role: against): They're not-- if I can just one sentence, all right?
Michael Doran (role: against): They're not going to go out and take risks in Turkey if they think that we might do like President Obama did a year ago with Syria and say, ""Ah, you know what?
Michael Doran (role: against): They need to know we're going to go all the way with them and back them no matter what happens, and that requires military force.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they're saying, ""At least we're keeping allies by going in and showing strength consistently.""
Paul Pillar (role: for): Yeah, one of the big myths about credibility is that any time we back away from something that's either a losing proposition or not worth the effort or isn't in defense of our key interests, that somehow people and governments all over the world are going to think, ""Oh, the Americans are a bunch of weak-kneed people who aren't going to stand up to their vital interests.""
Paul Pillar (role: for): And to understand that, how would we view the Russians or the Chinese or anyone else who backed away from or did not use military force or flex their muscles in something peripheral, something that was losing, something that was not in their vital interests?
Paul Pillar (role: for): Of course not.
John Donvan (role: mod): Bret Stephens.
Bret Stephens (role: against): I think Paul and I would agree that we do not want-- the American government does not want Israel to attack Iran in the event that Iran or the Israelis perceive that Iran is approaching a nuclear capability, some point of no return.
Bret Stephens (role: against): It tells them that America's promise that it will not allow Iran to get nuclear weapons is a totally hollow promise that they cannot trust.
Bret Stephens (role: against): You can ask the Israeli defense minister who is on record as saying this.
Bret Stephens (role: against): Why?
Bret Stephens (role: against): Same story with the Saudis.
Bret Stephens (role: against): The Saudis don't trust us anymore, which is why John Kerry had to go on bended knee to Riyadh a few weeks ago to say, ""No, this time we're actually serious.""
Aaron David Miller (role: for): We've spent the-- and, again, I haven't seen a piece of classified information since 2003, so what I'm about to say is my view-- we've spent the last several years trying to preempt the Israelis from striking Iran prematurely.
Aaron David Miller (role: for): This president may well be called on, Bret, to make good on that.
Michael Doran (role: against): Nobody in the Middle East believes he'll do that, not a single leader.
Michael Doran (role: against): Sorry.
Michael Doran (role: against): He's said it or he's signaled it, suggested it, and so on, but there is nobody, nobody in Riyadh nobody in Jerusalem, nobody in Baghdad, and nobody in Tehran believes that he will actually use military force to stop Iran.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 7.0, 'undecided_for': 19.0, 'for_against': 6.0, 'for_for': 20.0, 'undecided_against': 16.0, 'for_undecided': 2.0, 'undecided_undecided': 6.0, 'against_undecided': 2.0, 'against_against': 23.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 10.0, 'for': 45.0, 'against': 45.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 43.0, 'for': 26.0, 'against': 31.0}}",Aaron David Miller,for,"One is another consequential attack on the homeland-- I'm not talking about a lone wolf inspired attack, I'm talking about directed attack that leads to scores of American casualties, regardless of his actions now-- and the second, which three administrations have now committed themselves to, is Iran's crossing the threshold to weaponize--"

John Donvan (role: mod): You're not saying it will make things worse, but you're just not saying it's not going to make things better.
John Donvan (role: mod): And, Paul, and risking giving your opponents their point that you might agree with some of their-- sometimes you might think force is called for.
Paul Pillar (role: for): Well, one difference we've had between the two sides of the stage here, John, is that our opponents keep trying to make this a pro or anti-Obama administration thing, but that's definitely not the case.
Paul Pillar (role: for): The one substantive point I'd add, John, is that-- is this issue of political will, because ultimately, the fate of this group certainly in Iraq, but also in Syria, is going to depend on the politics and the capital-- and we've had some encouraging signs in Baghdad-- but further political evolution so that Iraqi Sunnis know that they've got a future in an Iraq that is not dominated by ISIS.

John Donvan (role: mod): And so I just want to bring it back to the principle of the debate-- question being asked by the debate, Paul.
Paul Pillar (role: for): I think overall the more deeply we get immersed into sectarian and internal conflicts in either Syria or Iraq, the greater are all the hazards that we've talked about of making things worse.
Paul Pillar (role: for): That does not mean there are not appropriate uses of military force such as rescuing the Yazidis on a mountaintop.

Paul Pillar (role: for): Yeah, Bret's absolutely right that we can't think in terms of what our dreams are in the Middle East.
Paul Pillar (role: for): Again, Iraq 2003, the outstanding example, 2003 plus 8 1/2 years, we had a dream, or at least the makers of that war had a dream of using the regime change in this central Middle Eastern state to stimulate free market economics and democracy, not just in Iraq but throughout the region.
Paul Pillar (role: for): It wasn't meeting a threat.
Paul Pillar (role: for): And that's one of the ways we went wrong.
Paul Pillar (role: for): And Bret gave a couple of excellent examples in his initial presentation, like World War II.

John Donvan (role: mod): That's not a threat to our national security.
Paul Pillar (role: for): Well, it was a threat to the Yazidis.
Paul Pillar (role: for): And I think there are some very tactical decisions that have been very difficult for the administration to make.
Paul Pillar (role: for): And I don't think Aaron and I are saying, despite the efforts of our worthy opponents to frame the debate in a way that we have to say that every use of military force is for the worst.
John Donvan (role: mod): Aaron?
Aaron David Miller (role: for): We have interests, allies and enemies there.
Aaron David Miller (role: for): You essentially apply a cruel and unforgiving standard to what constitutes American national interests, and you willfully pursue those interests.
Aaron David Miller (role: for): And when I say, ""vital,"" what do I mean by ""vital""?
Aaron David Miller (role: for): That leads you back to the one thing most Americans do care about, and that is the protection of the continental United States, which was--
Aaron David Miller (role: for): --in effect was the basis for Obama's intervention.
Michael Doran (role: against): Thanks.
Michael Doran (role: against): He said that the Middle East was bad-- or, no, was broken, angry and dysfunctional, which I think makes a nice acronym, BAD.

Michael Doran (role: against): And I would say that the Middle East is like having diabetes, right?
Michael Doran (role: against): You can't-- you can't get rid of it.
Michael Doran (role: against): And so my argument is that-- that a bias toward action and a bias toward military action is the best way to treat the disease rather than Paul's way, which is to-- which is basically to cordon off the area and stay away from it.
Michael Doran (role: against): I just want to make one point here about the importance of using military force.
Michael Doran (role: against): And allies-- this is a counterintuitive thing.
Michael Doran (role: against): And we want to-- we want to believe-- remember, there was this whole ""hard power, soft power"" thing.

John Donvan (role: mod): Bret Stephens.
Bret Stephens (role: against): I think Paul and I would agree that we do not want-- the American government does not want Israel to attack Iran in the event that Iran or the Israelis perceive that Iran is approaching a nuclear capability, some point of no return.
Bret Stephens (role: against): It tells them that America's promise that it will not allow Iran to get nuclear weapons is a totally hollow promise that they cannot trust.

Aaron David Miller (role: for): No, Bret, that's unfair.
John Donvan (role: mod): Actually, Bret, I have to say, you can win the debate taking that position, but it's a rather sterile-- sterile position to take in the situation where we're really trying to have a national conversation about this.

John Donvan (role: mod): That concludes opening statements for this Intelligence U.S. Squared debate.
John Donvan (role: mod): Here is where we are.
John Donvan (role: mod): We are about to enter into the part of the debate where the debaters address each other directly, and we also bring in you, the members of the audience, to ask questions.
John Donvan (role: mod): The way that we'll do that, is when we come to the questions is for you to raise your hand and I find you.
John Donvan (role: mod): There will be ushers with microphones.
John Donvan (role: mod): They'll bring a microphone to you.
John Donvan (role: mod): We'll ask you to stand.
John Donvan (role: mod): If you're a member of the news media or have any other relevant or interesting affiliation, we'd appreciate it if you'd share that with us.
John Donvan (role: mod): And when you get the microphone, if you can hold it about that far, distance away from your mouth, so that the radio broadcast where be able to hear you.
John Donvan (role: mod): Before the debate, we had you vote on where you stood on our motion, “Obama's foreign policy spells America's decline,” and we now have the results of that vote.
John Donvan (role: mod): Before the debate, this is where it stands, 23% of you are for the motion, 45% are against the motion, and 32% are undecided.
John Donvan (role: mod): That's where it stands now at the end of the debate we'll have you vote once again and the team that has changed the most minds during the course of the argument will be declared our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): So now on to round two where the debaters address each other directly.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have here at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts in New York University, the teams of two, Dan Senor and Mortimer Zuckerman who are arguing that Obama's foreign policy spells America's decline.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have made the argument that President Obama has snubbed old friends.
John Donvan (role: mod): On the other side, Wesley Clark and Bernard-Henri Lévy, who have made the argument that President Obama is setting out to make new friends.
John Donvan (role: mod): What we're really talking about on some level in terms of the person of President Obama is the matter of respect.
John Donvan (role: mod): Does the world respect him?
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to put that question to both sides briefly.
John Donvan (role: mod): First to the team for the motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): Is President Obama respected?
John Donvan (role: mod): And is it the right kind of respect?
John Donvan (role: mod): Mortimer Zuckerman.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I'm going to speak with a French accent, if you don't mind.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): This is unfair.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I will quote a major Asian leader who said-- very well-known Asian leader who said in the world of Asia, in the leadership of Asia which is the leadership that runs that part of the world-- we are concerned that Obama does not have the strength to confront his enemies, and we fear that he does not have the strength to support his friends.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): Now, I'm not saying that there isn't an expanded role for the media in many different parts of the world.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): In terms of the way political decisions and political power is exercised, I would ask you to think, if I may, do you think that the ability to speak is influencing the way political decisions are made in those parts of the world where we are trying to influence?
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): Do we think that we are getting through to the leadership because Obama gives speeches?
John Donvan (role: mod): So you do not think he's respected?
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): No, I think he is respected.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I don't think he is effective.
John Donvan (role: mod): To the other side.
John Donvan (role: mod): Wesley Clark.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I think he is effective.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I think what he's done first is set up a base of public understanding for his values and America's values, and his vision.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And I think he's very effectively captured world opinion on that.
Wesley Clark (role: against): He's, then, set about restoring the relationship with allies, fulfilling his responsibilities to protect the United States which he's done, and then trying to work to head off the greatest challenges we face.
Wesley Clark (role: against): So for example, you were talking about nuclear weapons, Mort.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And he called together a nuclear non proliferation summit in Washington.
Wesley Clark (role: against): People came.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And it was important.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And it was a private meeting.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And they came because they respect him and they respect what he stands for in the United States of America.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I think most of us would agree that the greatest single threat we face right now is a nuclear weapon in the hands of terrorists.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And that's the problem Barack Obama is focusing on.
Wesley Clark (role: against): So I give him high marks for the summit.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I give him high marks for moving ahead with the symbolism of a start agreement with Russia to reduce levels of nuclear weapons.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And I give him high marks for the general focus that he's brought to bear on looking to prevent future problems from emerging.
John Donvan (role: mod): Dan Senor.
Dan Senor (role: for): Yeah, I would just say that the fear of nuclear weapons getting to the hands of terrorists is not really an abstract debate.

John Donvan (role: mod): What we're really talking about on some level in terms of the person of President Obama is the matter of respect.
John Donvan (role: mod): On the other side, Wesley Clark and Bernard-Henri Lévy, who have made the argument that President Obama is setting out to make new friends.

Dan Senor (role: for): Because number one, that is your big get, is that Obama said that Pakistan poses a threat?
Dan Senor (role: for): Your big get is that Obama basically confirmed something we all know.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): President Bush during his 8 years delivered huge, unconditional, untied aid to Pakistan government without any conditions regarding the topic we are speaking today.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Number two: the speech of Cairo.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): I know Pakistan; I went in Algeria; I went in Afghanistan, the new strategy of McChrystal for example, today consisting of isolating the Taliban inside the civil society, demonstrating to the people in Afghanistan that their interest is not to protect the Taliban.
Dan Senor (role: for): Syria’s announced or it’s been reported that Syria’s sending Katyusha rockets to Lebanon to give to Hezbollah and more sophisticated weaponry than that.
Dan Senor (role: for): Exact-- so it was a great speech; it was very moving, and it was a poetic.
John Donvan (role: mod): Is that not meaningful?
Dan Senor (role: for): You had an opportunity in Iran.
Dan Senor (role: for): They were saying, where is America?
Dan Senor (role: for): America’s leaders and American presidents have put a spotlight on dissident movements, whether it was the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa; whether it was the Soviets dissident movement in the former Soviet Union, the oxygen for these movements is America keeping a spotlight on it.
Wesley Clark (role: against): In the first place, the inspiration for a lot of that movement came from the words of Barack Obama and his symbolism.
Wesley Clark (role: against): One of the things we did learn during the previous administration was that harsh rhetoric doesn't help.
Wesley Clark (role: against): It's what Ahmadinejad wants.
Wesley Clark (role: against): So Barack Obama played a very clever strategy in that.
Wesley Clark (role: against): Even though I know that I would like to believe that America could cause a revolt inside Iran, we have been talking about a change in regime through six administrations, and it hasn't happened in Iran yet.

Wesley Clark (role: against): Secondly-- Secondly, I think it's very interesting that you want to ask what's the benefit of a speech because one of the things that we should be talking about is concrete policies and specific actions.
Wesley Clark (role: against): Strong bull-headed rhetoric appeals to Americans, but it doesn't change foreign affairs.
Wesley Clark (role: against): It helps him consolidate his grip on power when we call him names.
Wesley Clark (role: against): It didn't work, but no-- you can't-- America, I'm sorry.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And so I don't think it's a legitimate criticism to say that Barack Obama gave a speech and the Iranian revolt against the Ahmadinejad didn't work.

Bernard-Henri Lévy<against>: Author of American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I mean I wasn't referring at that point-- at that point, we were in a position in Afghanistan, and there is an issue, a connection between Afghanistan and Pakistan as we all know.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): Because they do have 120 or whatever the number of nuclear weapons they have, and that is the worst thing that would happen if they fall into the wrong hands.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): So I don't diminish that.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I'm just saying that when you play this game out there, and it is, in a sense, an understanding of how to work in that community, I'm afraid that the rhetoric that is being saluted here is not nearly as effective as you would say and the policies that would be effective are simple not being carried out.
John Donvan (role: mod): Dan Senor.
Dan Senor (role: for): We are in an early stage of it.
Dan Senor (role: for): And it can be arrested.
Dan Senor (role: for): Then you're arguing that we're already in decline.
Dan Senor (role: for): And I would say that when you have a situation where leaders around the world, allies of ours, historic allies are openly calling us naive and questioning our commitment, and our loyalty, that will spell American decline because we can't do this on our own.
Dan Senor (role: for): You know, I agree with you that George W. Bush was extremely-- I'll be the first to admit, unpopular around the world.
Dan Senor (role: for): But one thing President Bush did have is very deep relationships with leaders, Aznar in Spain, Harper in Canada, Howard in Australia, Blair in the U.K., Sharon in Israel.
Dan Senor (role: for): Hold on.
Dan Senor (role: for): And that was an enormous mistake.
Dan Senor (role: for): So that was a big mistake by Bush, and I'm glad he ultimately agreed to move off that outreach to Russia.
Dan Senor (role: for): Blair, Berlusconi, Howard, Harper-- these leaders stood by Bush through thick and thin, even though their populations despised him.
Dan Senor (role: for): One leader around the world that is so moved by his speeches and so moved by the press release he put out saying that Pakistan has terrorists in it, point one leader that is willing to stand by him and who he has a very close alliance.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): I think it is because of my French accent that you did not get what I said.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): So I will repeat.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Maybe Sarkozy said that Barack Obama is naive, but-- He made – Sarkozy is not so important.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): And Barack Obama, the last poll two months ago arrive at 46 or 48--
Dan Senor (role: for): Governments make policy.
Dan Senor (role: for): That's very nice.
Dan Senor (role: for): One leader.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Real people, suffering people, losing their houses, suffering from terrorism, being fed up by fanaticism: this is a real actor of history.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I think the question you're asking, Dan, is a naive question.
Dan Senor (role: for): The inner Sarkozy in you.
Wesley Clark (role: against): So if you scratch-- If you scratch-- If you could scratch very deeply on someone like Prime Minister Blair, and no one has managed to scratch very deeply on him yet, he would tell you that he was trapped by his early support of the Bush administration in Iraq.
Wesley Clark (role: against): But if you talk to the people who were around him at the time, and were there, and all of a sudden we jumped in without a second UN Security Council resolution, he thought he could influence President Bush the way he could influence President Clinton.

John Donvan (role: mod): These have been two arguments against your point that the personal relationships are critical.
Dan Senor (role: for): It is clear that political leaders make decisions based on the domestic political situation.
Dan Senor (role: for): Two: security matters.
Dan Senor (role: for): And it was because not of some personal emotional relationship that they had with President Bush.
Dan Senor (role: for): Their sense of loyalty to President Bush was because of his commitment to them and his commitment to the security of their country which is what they ultimately care about and his commitment to security abroad.

Bernard-Henri Lévy<against>: Author of American Vertigo: Traveling America in the Footsteps of Tocqueville","Dan Senor (role: for): Yeah, I want to be clear here.
Dan Senor (role: for): In fact, several of the leaders I cited lost their elections because of their commitment to standing with the United States under President Bush.
Dan Senor (role: for): Probably security matters and I have a slightly less cynical view; security matters to these leaders, in many cases more than politics.
Dan Senor (role: for): I’m sorry if my American accent, I wasn’t able to make my point clear.
Dan Senor (role: for): And those leaders were willing to go the mat even if it meant risking their political careers to stand with him.
Dan Senor (role: for): To this day, Tony Blair is out of office.
Dan Senor (role: for): So I come back to you, you say policy makers don’t matter when it comes to policy?
Dan Senor (role: for): Policy makers make policy, and I don’t see a single policy maker in the world today despite the millions of people who have this affection for President Obama, which I think is heartfelt; I don’t see a single policy maker that is willing to stand up and go toe to toe and lock arms with this president.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to move on to some other topics.
John Donvan (role: mod): This may go on forever and I do want to move on.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go to the audience for some questions.
John Donvan (role: mod): But before we do that, I just want to go to a specific example to put this in more concrete terms and I would like to talk about China.
Dan Senor (role: for): It was stunning.
Dan Senor (role: for): It was a humiliating experience.
Dan Senor (role: for): The Chinese were allowed to choose who could attend this speech.
Dan Senor (role: for): Normally when presidents go, even if they intend to somewhat humiliate the president, they at least give them a couple of crumbs to leave with.
Dan Senor (role: for): Here we are today, Iran is on the cusp of developing a nuclear weapon and China still won’t support sanctions on the U.N. Security Council, still won’t support sanctions.
Dan Senor (role: for): So, I keep coming back to my question, what do we get?
John Donvan (role: mod): Response from the other side?
Wesley Clark (role: against): First of all, I’m not going to go into the details of the president’s trip to China except to say that our relationship with the Chinese is one of mutual need.
Wesley Clark (role: against): Now, whether or not China ultimately support sanctions on Iran in the United Nations is not going to be the decisive factor, I would predict, in this president’s decision about what to do about Iran.
Wesley Clark (role: against): Hypothetically, Iran’s going to get this, hypothetically Barack Obama’s not going to do that or something of the sort; I don’t think the record demonstrates that.
John Donvan (role: mod): But I think Dan Senor was also talking about process and his point was also that the President’s trip left the impression of weakness.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): This was the worst visit of any president that has been made to China and it is a critical country, whether or not they support what we want to do vis-a-vis Iran or not.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): And to deny that is to deny really what happened.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): You can argue why it happened.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): But whatever it was, it worked out in the worst way.
John Donvan (role: mod): Bernard-Henri Lévy.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): I think that there are two ways of considering the relationship between America and China.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): We have an enemy.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): We have to win this battle.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): This would be one way.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): You know better than me.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): The impression which was released, which was delivered by Obama's visit was the impression of a non-hysterical relationship, of a real partnership, of new ground, a new departure for a relationship based, of course, on different visions of the world; a totalitarian regime on one side, the embodiment of modern democracy on the other side, but nevertheless a constructive partnership.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): And--
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): There is some road to be done still, of course.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): It's not the end.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): That is a very optimistic vision of what happened on Barack's visit to China.

Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): There are not so many critics against Obama in Europe.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): What is very positive and very positively appreciated in Europe is that Obama engaged some troops in Afghanistan, maybe not enough according to some, but with some concrete, effective, and important results on the ground.

Dan Senor (role: for): To me, it’s important but it doesn’t make for a foreign policy.

Dan Senor (role: for): It was a bona fide dissident movement, almost one year ago today.
Dan Senor (role: for): Throughout modern histories, you know Bernard, because you’ve been very active on these human rights issues.
Dan Senor (role: for): Our president was silent.
Wesley Clark (role: against): Secondly-- Secondly, I think it's very interesting that you want to ask what's the benefit of a speech because one of the things that we should be talking about is concrete policies and specific actions.
Wesley Clark (role: against): Strong bull-headed rhetoric appeals to Americans, but it doesn't change foreign affairs.
Wesley Clark (role: against): It helps him consolidate his grip on power when we call him names.
Wesley Clark (role: against): It didn't work, but no-- you can't-- America, I'm sorry.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And so I don't think it's a legitimate criticism to say that Barack Obama gave a speech and the Iranian revolt against the Ahmadinejad didn't work.
Wesley Clark (role: against): But what is a demonstration of Barack Obama's strength is his staying with his commitment in Iraq.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And there is not a leader in the world who would look at Barack Obama and say he made an easy decision on that.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And those of you in this audience, I bet if you took a vote on that, the majority of this audience would not have supported him when he put those extra troops into Afghanistan, and yet that was the right call and it was a tough call.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I, too, have talked to foreign leaders, and Mort, that's what they tell me.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): Well, again, I hate to say this, but I think you're speaking only to foreign leaders who speak with a French accent.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): No, that's an unfair comment.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): Let me just say that.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): And there you have, I think, a couple of countries, and a couple of movements that are really threatening a lot of our allies, Iran being one.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): For Syria to have just provided scud missiles or their equivalent to Hezbollah is changing the whole military context of the region.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): And I don't dismiss entirely the rhetoric of the president.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I don't want to diminish what the value of rhetoric is.
John Donvan (role: mod): Wesley Clark just talked about a concrete move of putting more troops into Afghanistan.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I don't disagree with that.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): If there was a rationale for going into Afghanistan, it is to make sure that Pakistan does not collapse.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): So in a sense, we are protecting Pakistan and all of that.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I'm not saying that everything he's done is wrong.
John Donvan (role: mod): Our motion is “Obama's foreign policy spells America's decline,” and in arguing for this motion, are you saying that decline has begun already, we're in it?
Dan Senor (role: for): I think the prospect of decline is real.
John Donvan (role: mod): What is the--
Dan Senor (role: for): As General Clark and Bernard said-- General Clark in his opening statement said that America was in decline when Obama took over, that we were in a deep hole.
Dan Senor (role: for): And the question is now is Obama slowing it down?
Dan Senor (role: for): And I want to ask a question.

John Donvan (role: mod): To the other side.
John Donvan (role: mod): Wesley Clark.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I think he is effective.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I think what he's done first is set up a base of public understanding for his values and America's values, and his vision.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And I think he's very effectively captured world opinion on that.
Wesley Clark (role: against): He's, then, set about restoring the relationship with allies, fulfilling his responsibilities to protect the United States which he's done, and then trying to work to head off the greatest challenges we face.
Wesley Clark (role: against): So for example, you were talking about nuclear weapons, Mort.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And he called together a nuclear non proliferation summit in Washington.
Wesley Clark (role: against): People came.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And it was important.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And it was a private meeting.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And they came because they respect him and they respect what he stands for in the United States of America.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I think most of us would agree that the greatest single threat we face right now is a nuclear weapon in the hands of terrorists.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And that's the problem Barack Obama is focusing on.
Wesley Clark (role: against): So I give him high marks for the summit.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I give him high marks for moving ahead with the symbolism of a start agreement with Russia to reduce levels of nuclear weapons.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And I give him high marks for the general focus that he's brought to bear on looking to prevent future problems from emerging.
John Donvan (role: mod): Dan Senor.
Dan Senor (role: for): Yeah, I would just say that the fear of nuclear weapons getting to the hands of terrorists is not really an abstract debate.
Dan Senor (role: for): I mean Iran, according to IAEA, according to our own intelligence community Iran will have some sort of nuclear weapon, some sort of breakout capacity very soon: two years, three years.
Dan Senor (role: for): That’s really quick, 2015 perhaps, 2016.
Dan Senor (role: for): We still don’t have a Security Council resolution despite high approval, public opinion approval of President Obama around the world.
Dan Senor (role: for): The Chinese won’t get on board, the Russians won’t get on board.
Dan Senor (role: for): The Iranians basically say and the IEAE says, that Iran has mastered something like 3000 centrifuges, enough to actually build a weapon.
Dan Senor (role: for): I mean, speeches and personal biography and personal charisma are wonderful, they’re nice; I think people around the world like us.

Dan Senor (role: for): What have we gotten?
John Donvan (role: mod): Bernard?
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Barack Obama is your first president and first leader of high rank that has said that the risk of the terrorist group having a nuclear device in their hands will happen, could happen in Pakistan.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): You had a president who said it was Iraq and who looked for the nuclear weapons with a lamp torch.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): This changed all the deal inside Pakistani power, inside the ISI, and more importantly inside civil society in Pakistan.
John Donvan (role: mod): Wait, while we hold that because I want to

Mort Zuckerman (role: for): It's just not enough.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I hope that they are wrong and I hope that I am wrong.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I mean, this is not something that I'm making out of thin air.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): So I support engagement but engagement is one hand, the other hand is they have to-- you have to be able to deal not just with a handshake but with a clenched fist.
John Donvan (role: mod): We are in the question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S.
John Donvan (role: mod): I'm John Donvan as moderator.
John Donvan (role: mod): And, sir, just, you can nod or not, I just want to ask you your critique of the President's performance is more a critique from the left, that he's become too muscular, am I correct about that, that you're citing that critique?
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): There are not so many critics against Obama in Europe.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): What is very positive and very positively appreciated in Europe is that Obama engaged some troops in Afghanistan, maybe not enough according to some, but with some concrete, effective, and important results on the ground.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Number one, as I said, inside of Afghanistan, isolation of the Taliban.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): The Taliban are less and less fish in water in some of the valleys where they were kings a few months ago.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Two years after.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): You have some national Afghan battling units with some embedded American-- not scouts but mentors.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let’s see if your opponents concede that point or not.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): I emphasize.
Dan Senor (role: for): As I made it clear at the beginning of this talk this evening, I think President Obama’s decision to support General Petraeus and General McChrystal in Afghanistan was enormously important.
Dan Senor (role: for): I think we’re potentially heading for a crisis on the ground in Afghanistan as it relates to civilian-military coordination.
Dan Senor (role: for): To me, it’s important but it doesn’t make for a foreign policy.
Dan Senor (role: for): Throughout your career you have advocated for human rights and the importance of standing with dissonant movements, even as a centerpiece of foreign policy.
Dan Senor (role: for): Only one leader from the Left in the United States signed it, the head of Amnesty International USA.
Dan Senor (role: for): It’s a sad statement of affairs, and I’m amazed that you are giving him a pass.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Today, the real shock of civilization is inside Islam, inside Islam between Islam, democratic Islam and integrist and fanatic Islam.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): That we are on their side.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): This also is human rights.
Dan Senor (role: for): Can I ask you a question?
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): He did this in a way because it was a very complicated story.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): You had some dissidents who were shot dead like Neda in the streets and this was a very responsible attitude to have in front of butchers.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): And I think that the concern of every responsible Western leader was to avoid in Tehran a Tiananmen.
Dan Senor (role: for): Iranian regime's response-- Iranian regime's response made Tiananmen look like a day at the park.

Dan Senor (role: for): Yeah, I want to be clear here.
Dan Senor (role: for): In fact, several of the leaders I cited lost their elections because of their commitment to standing with the United States under President Bush.
Dan Senor (role: for): Probably security matters and I have a slightly less cynical view; security matters to these leaders, in many cases more than politics.
Dan Senor (role: for): I’m sorry if my American accent, I wasn’t able to make my point clear.
Dan Senor (role: for): And those leaders were willing to go the mat even if it meant risking their political careers to stand with him.
Dan Senor (role: for): To this day, Tony Blair is out of office.
Dan Senor (role: for): So I come back to you, you say policy makers don’t matter when it comes to policy?
Dan Senor (role: for): Policy makers make policy, and I don’t see a single policy maker in the world today despite the millions of people who have this affection for President Obama, which I think is heartfelt; I don’t see a single policy maker that is willing to stand up and go toe to toe and lock arms with this president.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to move on to some other topics.
John Donvan (role: mod): This may go on forever and I do want to move on.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go to the audience for some questions.
John Donvan (role: mod): But before we do that, I just want to go to a specific example to put this in more concrete terms and I would like to talk about China.
Dan Senor (role: for): It was stunning.
Dan Senor (role: for): It was a humiliating experience.
Dan Senor (role: for): The Chinese were allowed to choose who could attend this speech.
Dan Senor (role: for): Normally when presidents go, even if they intend to somewhat humiliate the president, they at least give them a couple of crumbs to leave with.
Dan Senor (role: for): Here we are today, Iran is on the cusp of developing a nuclear weapon and China still won’t support sanctions on the U.N. Security Council, still won’t support sanctions.
Dan Senor (role: for): So, I keep coming back to my question, what do we get?
John Donvan (role: mod): Response from the other side?
Wesley Clark (role: against): First of all, I’m not going to go into the details of the president’s trip to China except to say that our relationship with the Chinese is one of mutual need.
Wesley Clark (role: against): Now, whether or not China ultimately support sanctions on Iran in the United Nations is not going to be the decisive factor, I would predict, in this president’s decision about what to do about Iran.
Wesley Clark (role: against): Hypothetically, Iran’s going to get this, hypothetically Barack Obama’s not going to do that or something of the sort; I don’t think the record demonstrates that.
John Donvan (role: mod): But I think Dan Senor was also talking about process and his point was also that the President’s trip left the impression of weakness.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): This was the worst visit of any president that has been made to China and it is a critical country, whether or not they support what we want to do vis-a-vis Iran or not.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): And to deny that is to deny really what happened.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): You can argue why it happened.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): But whatever it was, it worked out in the worst way.
John Donvan (role: mod): Bernard-Henri Lévy.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): I think that there are two ways of considering the relationship between America and China.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): We have an enemy.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): We have to win this battle.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): This would be one way.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): You know better than me.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): The impression which was released, which was delivered by Obama's visit was the impression of a non-hysterical relationship, of a real partnership, of new ground, a new departure for a relationship based, of course, on different visions of the world; a totalitarian regime on one side, the embodiment of modern democracy on the other side, but nevertheless a constructive partnership.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): And--
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): There is some road to be done still, of course.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): It's not the end.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): That is a very optimistic vision of what happened on Barack's visit to China.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I haven't seen a single person who understands what goes on in China, who thought that was a successful visit that in fact we came out with an enhanced relationship.","{'breakdown': None, 'post': {'undecided': 8.0, 'for': 34.0, 'against': 58.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 32.0, 'for': 23.0, 'against': 45.0}}",Mort Zuckerman,for,It was a diminished relationship.

John Donvan (role: mod): I want to put that question to both sides briefly.
John Donvan (role: mod): Does the world respect him?
John Donvan (role: mod): What we're really talking about on some level in terms of the person of President Obama is the matter of respect.
John Donvan (role: mod): On the other side, Wesley Clark and Bernard-Henri Lévy, who have made the argument that President Obama is setting out to make new friends.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have made the argument that President Obama has snubbed old friends.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have here at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts in New York University, the teams of two, Dan Senor and Mortimer Zuckerman who are arguing that Obama's foreign policy spells America's decline.

John Donvan (role: mod): That's where it stands now at the end of the debate we'll have you vote once again and the team that has changed the most minds during the course of the argument will be declared our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): Before the debate, this is where it stands, 23% of you are for the motion, 45% are against the motion, and 32% are undecided.
John Donvan (role: mod): Before the debate, we had you vote on where you stood on our motion, “Obama's foreign policy spells America's decline,” and we now have the results of that vote.
John Donvan (role: mod): And when you get the microphone, if you can hold it about that far, distance away from your mouth, so that the radio broadcast where be able to hear you.

John Donvan (role: mod): We are about to enter into the part of the debate where the debaters address each other directly, and we also bring in you, the members of the audience, to ask questions.
John Donvan (role: mod): Here is where we are.
John Donvan (role: mod): That concludes opening statements for this Intelligence U.S. Squared debate.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Bernard-Henri Lévy.
Dan Senor (role: for): Nations don’t make major decisions about their security because President Obama gives a nice speech.
Dan Senor (role: for): So I guess I would ask either of you, show me one example, one, that has generated any benefit in response to Obama’s wonderful speeches.
Dan Senor (role: for): I mean the ultimate measure is Iran’s about the build a nuclear bomb so what have his speeches done to arrest that progress.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): I give you two examples.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): He is the first one who has designated Pakistan as a major problem.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Barack Obama said that the problem is in Pakistan.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Example number two.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Two examples.
Dan Senor (role: for): One of the rationales that Bush used for going into Afghanistan is that Pakistan could follow and has its hands on nuclear weapons and those nuclear weapons could get in the wrong hands.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let’s here number two, example number two.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Barack Obama has changed that and this is not speech, this is act.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): You know, the best way to help your friends is to disarm the enemies of your friends and the speech of Cairo had one concrete effect, which is to comfort the moderates in Islam, to isolate the people of al-Qaeda, the fanatics and the integrists, to divide the Muslim world, and this is-- Which has concrete effects on the ground, I can tell you.
Dan Senor (role: for): Hamas is stronger today than it was a year ago.
Dan Senor (role: for): I mean, Iran as I said is nowhere near slowing down their nuclear weaponization program.
John Donvan (role: mod): Dan, what Bernard is saying is that its concrete effect was to tell the moderates out there we are with you.
Dan Senor (role: for): I would say it’s nice, but at the end of the day, the moderates need to know that we are going to stand with them and exactly what has Barack Obama indicated in terms of what political capital and what resources America will expend to stand with these moderates?

Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): You had a president who said it was Iraq and who looked for the nuclear weapons with a lamp torch.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): This changed all the deal inside Pakistani power, inside the ISI, and more importantly inside civil society in Pakistan.
John Donvan (role: mod): Wait, while we hold that because I want to
Dan Senor (role: for): Because number one, that is your big get, is that Obama said that Pakistan poses a threat?
Dan Senor (role: for): Your big get is that Obama basically confirmed something we all know.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): President Bush during his 8 years delivered huge, unconditional, untied aid to Pakistan government without any conditions regarding the topic we are speaking today.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Number two: the speech of Cairo.

Dan Senor (role: for): Syria’s announced or it’s been reported that Syria’s sending Katyusha rockets to Lebanon to give to Hezbollah and more sophisticated weaponry than that.

John Donvan (role: mod): And is it the right kind of respect?
John Donvan (role: mod): Is President Obama respected?
John Donvan (role: mod): First to the team for the motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to put that question to both sides briefly.
John Donvan (role: mod): Does the world respect him?
John Donvan (role: mod): What we're really talking about on some level in terms of the person of President Obama is the matter of respect.
John Donvan (role: mod): On the other side, Wesley Clark and Bernard-Henri Lévy, who have made the argument that President Obama is setting out to make new friends.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have made the argument that President Obama has snubbed old friends.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have here at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts in New York University, the teams of two, Dan Senor and Mortimer Zuckerman who are arguing that Obama's foreign policy spells America's decline.
John Donvan (role: mod): So now on to round two where the debaters address each other directly.
John Donvan (role: mod): That's where it stands now at the end of the debate we'll have you vote once again and the team that has changed the most minds during the course of the argument will be declared our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): Before the debate, this is where it stands, 23% of you are for the motion, 45% are against the motion, and 32% are undecided.
John Donvan (role: mod): Before the debate, we had you vote on where you stood on our motion, “Obama's foreign policy spells America's decline,” and we now have the results of that vote.
John Donvan (role: mod): And when you get the microphone, if you can hold it about that far, distance away from your mouth, so that the radio broadcast where be able to hear you.

John Donvan (role: mod): They'll bring a microphone to you.
John Donvan (role: mod): There will be ushers with microphones.
John Donvan (role: mod): The way that we'll do that, is when we come to the questions is for you to raise your hand and I find you.
John Donvan (role: mod): We are about to enter into the part of the debate where the debaters address each other directly, and we also bring in you, the members of the audience, to ask questions.
John Donvan (role: mod): Here is where we are.
John Donvan (role: mod): That concludes opening statements for this Intelligence U.S. Squared debate.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Bernard-Henri Lévy.
Dan Senor (role: for): Nations don’t make major decisions about their security because President Obama gives a nice speech.
Dan Senor (role: for): So I guess I would ask either of you, show me one example, one, that has generated any benefit in response to Obama’s wonderful speeches.
Dan Senor (role: for): I mean the ultimate measure is Iran’s about the build a nuclear bomb so what have his speeches done to arrest that progress.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): I give you two examples.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): He is the first one who has designated Pakistan as a major problem.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Barack Obama said that the problem is in Pakistan.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Example number two.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Two examples.
Dan Senor (role: for): One of the rationales that Bush used for going into Afghanistan is that Pakistan could follow and has its hands on nuclear weapons and those nuclear weapons could get in the wrong hands.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let’s here number two, example number two.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Barack Obama has changed that and this is not speech, this is act.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): You know, the best way to help your friends is to disarm the enemies of your friends and the speech of Cairo had one concrete effect, which is to comfort the moderates in Islam, to isolate the people of al-Qaeda, the fanatics and the integrists, to divide the Muslim world, and this is-- Which has concrete effects on the ground, I can tell you.
Dan Senor (role: for): Hamas is stronger today than it was a year ago.
Dan Senor (role: for): I mean, Iran as I said is nowhere near slowing down their nuclear weaponization program.
John Donvan (role: mod): Dan, what Bernard is saying is that its concrete effect was to tell the moderates out there we are with you.
Dan Senor (role: for): I would say it’s nice, but at the end of the day, the moderates need to know that we are going to stand with them and exactly what has Barack Obama indicated in terms of what political capital and what resources America will expend to stand with these moderates?
Dan Senor (role: for): It was a bona fide dissident movement, almost one year ago today.","{'breakdown': None, 'post': {'undecided': 8.0, 'for': 34.0, 'against': 58.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 32.0, 'for': 23.0, 'against': 45.0}}",Dan Senor,for,"Throughout modern histories, you know Bernard, because you’ve been very active on these human rights issues."

Dan Senor (role: for): America’s leaders and American presidents have put a spotlight on dissident movements, whether it was the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa; whether it was the Soviets dissident movement in the former Soviet Union, the oxygen for these movements is America keeping a spotlight on it.
Wesley Clark (role: against): In the first place, the inspiration for a lot of that movement came from the words of Barack Obama and his symbolism.
Wesley Clark (role: against): One of the things we did learn during the previous administration was that harsh rhetoric doesn't help.
Wesley Clark (role: against): It's what Ahmadinejad wants.
Wesley Clark (role: against): So Barack Obama played a very clever strategy in that.
Wesley Clark (role: against): Even though I know that I would like to believe that America could cause a revolt inside Iran, we have been talking about a change in regime through six administrations, and it hasn't happened in Iran yet.

Mort Zuckerman (role: for): The one area of the world where we have to worry about is frankly the Middle East.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): The movements in Hezbollah and Hamas, basically terrorist groups of that sort.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): Nothing is stopping these people.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I'm just saying that in that part of the world you need a lot more than rhetoric.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): But you have to translate that into other policies that really do have an effect against the people who are threatening.
John Donvan (role: mod): That wasn't rhetoric.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I mean I wasn't referring at that point-- at that point, we were in a position in Afghanistan, and there is an issue, a connection between Afghanistan and Pakistan as we all know.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): Because they do have 120 or whatever the number of nuclear weapons they have, and that is the worst thing that would happen if they fall into the wrong hands.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): So I don't diminish that.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I'm just saying that when you play this game out there, and it is, in a sense, an understanding of how to work in that community, I'm afraid that the rhetoric that is being saluted here is not nearly as effective as you would say and the policies that would be effective are simple not being carried out.

Dan Senor (role: for): And it can be arrested.
Dan Senor (role: for): Then you're arguing that we're already in decline.
Dan Senor (role: for): And I would say that when you have a situation where leaders around the world, allies of ours, historic allies are openly calling us naive and questioning our commitment, and our loyalty, that will spell American decline because we can't do this on our own.
Dan Senor (role: for): You know, I agree with you that George W. Bush was extremely-- I'll be the first to admit, unpopular around the world.

Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I will quote a major Asian leader who said-- very well-known Asian leader who said in the world of Asia, in the leadership of Asia which is the leadership that runs that part of the world-- we are concerned that Obama does not have the strength to confront his enemies, and we fear that he does not have the strength to support his friends.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): Now, I'm not saying that there isn't an expanded role for the media in many different parts of the world.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): In terms of the way political decisions and political power is exercised, I would ask you to think, if I may, do you think that the ability to speak is influencing the way political decisions are made in those parts of the world where we are trying to influence?
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): Do we think that we are getting through to the leadership because Obama gives speeches?
John Donvan (role: mod): So you do not think he's respected?
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): No, I think he is respected.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I don't think he is effective.
John Donvan (role: mod): To the other side.
John Donvan (role: mod): Wesley Clark.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I think he is effective.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I think what he's done first is set up a base of public understanding for his values and America's values, and his vision.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And I think he's very effectively captured world opinion on that.
Wesley Clark (role: against): He's, then, set about restoring the relationship with allies, fulfilling his responsibilities to protect the United States which he's done, and then trying to work to head off the greatest challenges we face.
Wesley Clark (role: against): So for example, you were talking about nuclear weapons, Mort.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And he called together a nuclear non proliferation summit in Washington.
Wesley Clark (role: against): People came.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And it was important.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And it was a private meeting.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And they came because they respect him and they respect what he stands for in the United States of America.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I think most of us would agree that the greatest single threat we face right now is a nuclear weapon in the hands of terrorists.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And that's the problem Barack Obama is focusing on.
Wesley Clark (role: against): So I give him high marks for the summit.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I give him high marks for moving ahead with the symbolism of a start agreement with Russia to reduce levels of nuclear weapons.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And I give him high marks for the general focus that he's brought to bear on looking to prevent future problems from emerging.
John Donvan (role: mod): Dan Senor.
Dan Senor (role: for): Yeah, I would just say that the fear of nuclear weapons getting to the hands of terrorists is not really an abstract debate.
Dan Senor (role: for): I mean Iran, according to IAEA, according to our own intelligence community Iran will have some sort of nuclear weapon, some sort of breakout capacity very soon: two years, three years.
Dan Senor (role: for): That’s really quick, 2015 perhaps, 2016.
Dan Senor (role: for): We still don’t have a Security Council resolution despite high approval, public opinion approval of President Obama around the world.
Dan Senor (role: for): The Chinese won’t get on board, the Russians won’t get on board.

Dan Senor (role: for): And the question is now is Obama slowing it down?
Dan Senor (role: for): And I want to ask a question.
Dan Senor (role: for): He got much bigger crowds opposing him traveling around the world than Barack Obama gets supporting him.

Dan Senor (role: for): Just one.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): I suppose.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): The characteristic of the period where we are is that Berlusconi, Zapatero, and even Sarkozy might be less important today than the peoples, than the masses, the huge crowds who all over the world were fed by your rubbish anti- Americanism for ages, and who are slightly changing their mind.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): More important than Sarkozy is that you have, as you know, an annual poll judging the big leaders of the world.
Dan Senor (role: for): Those polls don't make policy.
Dan Senor (role: for): There is not a single government?
Dan Senor (role: for): They applaud for him-- Tell me one leader.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): History is not made by Berlusconi.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): And in front of these people Barack Obama is much more popular than has been your--
Wesley Clark (role: against): I'll tell you why.
Wesley Clark (role: against): Because if you believe that leaders stand by the United States because of some personal relationship with the president, then you're neglecting the whole political basis for their own mandate in their own country.
Wesley Clark (role: against): He has defended it and defended and defended it because that's what political leaders do.
Wesley Clark (role: against): He signed up on his team, he jumped in there and it turned out there was no influence at all.
Wesley Clark (role: against): That's what motivates political leaders.
Wesley Clark (role: against): They couldn't back away from them, not because of their great respect for an American president but because of their own domestic politics.
Wesley Clark (role: against): He’s going to make smart policy decisions.
Wesley Clark (role: against): He’s going to moderate the domestic opponents around the world of our policies.
John Donvan (role: mod): So Dan, you need a shot back.
Dan Senor (role: for): Yeah, I want to be clear here.
Dan Senor (role: for): In fact, several of the leaders I cited lost their elections because of their commitment to standing with the United States under President Bush.

Dan Senor (role: for): Exact-- so it was a great speech; it was very moving, and it was a poetic.
John Donvan (role: mod): Is that not meaningful?
Dan Senor (role: for): You had an opportunity in Iran.
Dan Senor (role: for): They were saying, where is America?
Dan Senor (role: for): America’s leaders and American presidents have put a spotlight on dissident movements, whether it was the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa; whether it was the Soviets dissident movement in the former Soviet Union, the oxygen for these movements is America keeping a spotlight on it.
Wesley Clark (role: against): In the first place, the inspiration for a lot of that movement came from the words of Barack Obama and his symbolism.
Wesley Clark (role: against): One of the things we did learn during the previous administration was that harsh rhetoric doesn't help.
Wesley Clark (role: against): It's what Ahmadinejad wants.
Wesley Clark (role: against): So Barack Obama played a very clever strategy in that.
Wesley Clark (role: against): Even though I know that I would like to believe that America could cause a revolt inside Iran, we have been talking about a change in regime through six administrations, and it hasn't happened in Iran yet.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I mean that's not cause and effect.
Wesley Clark (role: against): It is reinforcing in Afghanistan.
Wesley Clark (role: against): He did not pander to the American public.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And he is recognized around the world for his courage in making that call.
John Donvan (role: mod): Mort Zuckerman.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I don't know what else to tell you.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): Look.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): The one area of the world where we have to worry about is frankly the Middle East.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): The movements in Hezbollah and Hamas, basically terrorist groups of that sort.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): Nothing is stopping these people.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I'm just saying that in that part of the world you need a lot more than rhetoric.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): But you have to translate that into other policies that really do have an effect against the people who are threatening.
John Donvan (role: mod): That wasn't rhetoric.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I mean I wasn't referring at that point-- at that point, we were in a position in Afghanistan, and there is an issue, a connection between Afghanistan and Pakistan as we all know.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): Because they do have 120 or whatever the number of nuclear weapons they have, and that is the worst thing that would happen if they fall into the wrong hands.","{'breakdown': None, 'post': {'undecided': 8.0, 'for': 34.0, 'against': 58.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 32.0, 'for': 23.0, 'against': 45.0}}",Mort Zuckerman,for,So I don't diminish that.

Dan Senor (role: for): And I would say that when you have a situation where leaders around the world, allies of ours, historic allies are openly calling us naive and questioning our commitment, and our loyalty, that will spell American decline because we can't do this on our own.
Dan Senor (role: for): You know, I agree with you that George W. Bush was extremely-- I'll be the first to admit, unpopular around the world.
Dan Senor (role: for): But one thing President Bush did have is very deep relationships with leaders, Aznar in Spain, Harper in Canada, Howard in Australia, Blair in the U.K., Sharon in Israel.
Dan Senor (role: for): Hold on.
Dan Senor (role: for): And that was an enormous mistake.
Dan Senor (role: for): So that was a big mistake by Bush, and I'm glad he ultimately agreed to move off that outreach to Russia.
Dan Senor (role: for): Blair, Berlusconi, Howard, Harper-- these leaders stood by Bush through thick and thin, even though their populations despised him.
Dan Senor (role: for): One leader around the world that is so moved by his speeches and so moved by the press release he put out saying that Pakistan has terrorists in it, point one leader that is willing to stand by him and who he has a very close alliance.

Wesley Clark (role: against): But if you talk to the people who were around him at the time, and were there, and all of a sudden we jumped in without a second UN Security Council resolution, he thought he could influence President Bush the way he could influence President Clinton.

Dan Senor (role: for): It is clear that political leaders make decisions based on the domestic political situation.
Dan Senor (role: for): Two: security matters.
Dan Senor (role: for): And it was because not of some personal emotional relationship that they had with President Bush.
Dan Senor (role: for): Their sense of loyalty to President Bush was because of his commitment to them and his commitment to the security of their country which is what they ultimately care about and his commitment to security abroad.
Dan Senor (role: for): You say Tony Blair was trapped.
Dan Senor (role: for): To this day, he defends the decisions he made.
Dan Senor (role: for): I mean that’s the most inverted metric I’ve ever heard.

Dan Senor (role: for): I’ve never heard such unanimous criticism of a president’s visit to China from across the political spectrum from the left and the right in the United States.
Dan Senor (role: for): The Chinese were allowed to censor his speech on the ground.
Dan Senor (role: for): Students as you know, many students were kept out and he left China with no concessions from the Chinese.

Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I'm not dismissing engagement.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): And as I say, the view that so many of them have is that they don't think he is going to be tough enough to deal with the issues that really have to be dealt with in a tough-minded way.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): But the evidence so far frankly is not encouraging, and frankly when you deal with those people, they are not encouraged.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I promise you that this is what they are saying and what they are very concerned about.
John Donvan (role: mod): I need to say something for the radio broadcast.
John Donvan (role: mod): Debate.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have four debaters; two teams of two, who are arguing over this motion, ""Obama's Foreign Policy Spells America's Decline.""
John Donvan (role: mod): So he's getting it from the other side, and I believe for now that's also the case often in Europe, that where people are disappointed in Europe with the President is that, in fact, he did send troops into Afghanistan and that he went to accept his Nobel Prize and made an argument in support of war and certain causes, and that, in fact, they thought he was too tough, which is the opposite of this side.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): I don't think so.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): This is an important point, with some troops, not as many as some would have wanted some real results, two sorts of results, and you have to be very concrete and go into details to appreciate these sort of things.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): This is a new reality on the ground.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Number two, I happened to be-- I’m sorry but I was in Afghanistan two years ago and I saw some units, offensive units, which were American units, fighting units, with some Afghan scouts embedded in the American units.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Now, a few months ago, it is the reverse.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): I mean by that that the situation on the ground is changing, that the new strategy implemented by Barack Obama and his high command has begun to give its fruits.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): It is concrete.
Dan Senor (role: for): Look.
Dan Senor (role: for): I actually have deep concerns about Afghanistan right now, about the civilian/military coordination.
Dan Senor (role: for): But that said, I don’t take one ounce away from the President’s courageous decision on Afghanistan.
Dan Senor (role: for): Bernard, look, I have been a great admirer of yours.
Dan Senor (role: for): There were about 40 individuals that signed a letter to the President on the eve of his trip to Moscow asking to meet with opposition, with democratic opposition figures in Moscow while he was there.
Dan Senor (role: for): And as one Left-wing blog commented, it’s a sad statement of the state of affairs that human rights has so been subordinated as a principle in our foreign policy that if someone from the Left wants to advocate for human rights being an important part of a president’s visit to Russia, to China, to any of these places, they have to sign a letter with a bunch of neocons like myself.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): The question of human rights is also a question inside Islam.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): In these battles, which is the most important battle of the moment, Obama is and his team and Clinton are playing a major role in separating the two in isolating the fanatics and the integrists from the moderates, in saying to the moderate Muslims that we are no longer their enemies.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): That we’re facing the same problems and that we are sharing the same values.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Why-- All over the Muslim world heard, listened, and heard the message.
Dan Senor (role: for): Why didn’t he give that exact speech you just gave when the dissidents were rising up in Iran?
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Mousavi was nearly under arrest, was threatened with death.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Ahmadinejad is not a president, he’s a butcher.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): There was the threat of a huge Tiananmen, ten times maybe more bloody than Tiananmen and I think that Obama acted not so badly between the human rights talks between the human right attitude and between the accountability in front of what could happen on the other side.
Dan Senor (role: for): The regime was more repressive today than it has been at any time.

Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I will quote a major Asian leader who said-- very well-known Asian leader who said in the world of Asia, in the leadership of Asia which is the leadership that runs that part of the world-- we are concerned that Obama does not have the strength to confront his enemies, and we fear that he does not have the strength to support his friends.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): Now, I'm not saying that there isn't an expanded role for the media in many different parts of the world.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): In terms of the way political decisions and political power is exercised, I would ask you to think, if I may, do you think that the ability to speak is influencing the way political decisions are made in those parts of the world where we are trying to influence?

Wesley Clark (role: against): And I think he's very effectively captured world opinion on that.
Wesley Clark (role: against): He's, then, set about restoring the relationship with allies, fulfilling his responsibilities to protect the United States which he's done, and then trying to work to head off the greatest challenges we face.
Wesley Clark (role: against): So for example, you were talking about nuclear weapons, Mort.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And he called together a nuclear non proliferation summit in Washington.
Wesley Clark (role: against): People came.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And it was important.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And it was a private meeting.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And they came because they respect him and they respect what he stands for in the United States of America.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I think most of us would agree that the greatest single threat we face right now is a nuclear weapon in the hands of terrorists.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And that's the problem Barack Obama is focusing on.
Wesley Clark (role: against): So I give him high marks for the summit.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I give him high marks for moving ahead with the symbolism of a start agreement with Russia to reduce levels of nuclear weapons.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And I give him high marks for the general focus that he's brought to bear on looking to prevent future problems from emerging.
John Donvan (role: mod): Dan Senor.
Dan Senor (role: for): Yeah, I would just say that the fear of nuclear weapons getting to the hands of terrorists is not really an abstract debate.
Dan Senor (role: for): I mean Iran, according to IAEA, according to our own intelligence community Iran will have some sort of nuclear weapon, some sort of breakout capacity very soon: two years, three years.
Dan Senor (role: for): That’s really quick, 2015 perhaps, 2016.
Dan Senor (role: for): We still don’t have a Security Council resolution despite high approval, public opinion approval of President Obama around the world.
Dan Senor (role: for): The Chinese won’t get on board, the Russians won’t get on board.
Dan Senor (role: for): The Iranians basically say and the IEAE says, that Iran has mastered something like 3000 centrifuges, enough to actually build a weapon.
Dan Senor (role: for): I mean, speeches and personal biography and personal charisma are wonderful, they’re nice; I think people around the world like us.
Dan Senor (role: for): I think they’re just limited commodities in foreign affairs.

John Donvan (role: mod): So you do not think he's respected?
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): Do we think that we are getting through to the leadership because Obama gives speeches?
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): In terms of the way political decisions and political power is exercised, I would ask you to think, if I may, do you think that the ability to speak is influencing the way political decisions are made in those parts of the world where we are trying to influence?
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): Now, I'm not saying that there isn't an expanded role for the media in many different parts of the world.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I will quote a major Asian leader who said-- very well-known Asian leader who said in the world of Asia, in the leadership of Asia which is the leadership that runs that part of the world-- we are concerned that Obama does not have the strength to confront his enemies, and we fear that he does not have the strength to support his friends.

John Donvan (role: mod): Is President Obama respected?
John Donvan (role: mod): First to the team for the motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to put that question to both sides briefly.
John Donvan (role: mod): Does the world respect him?
John Donvan (role: mod): What we're really talking about on some level in terms of the person of President Obama is the matter of respect.
John Donvan (role: mod): On the other side, Wesley Clark and Bernard-Henri Lévy, who have made the argument that President Obama is setting out to make new friends.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have made the argument that President Obama has snubbed old friends.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have here at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts in New York University, the teams of two, Dan Senor and Mortimer Zuckerman who are arguing that Obama's foreign policy spells America's decline.
John Donvan (role: mod): So now on to round two where the debaters address each other directly.
John Donvan (role: mod): That's where it stands now at the end of the debate we'll have you vote once again and the team that has changed the most minds during the course of the argument will be declared our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): Before the debate, this is where it stands, 23% of you are for the motion, 45% are against the motion, and 32% are undecided.
John Donvan (role: mod): Before the debate, we had you vote on where you stood on our motion, “Obama's foreign policy spells America's decline,” and we now have the results of that vote.
John Donvan (role: mod): And when you get the microphone, if you can hold it about that far, distance away from your mouth, so that the radio broadcast where be able to hear you.
John Donvan (role: mod): If you're a member of the news media or have any other relevant or interesting affiliation, we'd appreciate it if you'd share that with us.
John Donvan (role: mod): We'll ask you to stand.
John Donvan (role: mod): They'll bring a microphone to you.
John Donvan (role: mod): There will be ushers with microphones.
John Donvan (role: mod): The way that we'll do that, is when we come to the questions is for you to raise your hand and I find you.
John Donvan (role: mod): We are about to enter into the part of the debate where the debaters address each other directly, and we also bring in you, the members of the audience, to ask questions.
John Donvan (role: mod): Here is where we are.
John Donvan (role: mod): That concludes opening statements for this Intelligence U.S. Squared debate.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Bernard-Henri Lévy.
Dan Senor (role: for): Nations don’t make major decisions about their security because President Obama gives a nice speech.
Dan Senor (role: for): So I guess I would ask either of you, show me one example, one, that has generated any benefit in response to Obama’s wonderful speeches.
Dan Senor (role: for): I mean the ultimate measure is Iran’s about the build a nuclear bomb so what have his speeches done to arrest that progress.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): I give you two examples.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): He is the first one who has designated Pakistan as a major problem.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Barack Obama said that the problem is in Pakistan.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Example number two.
Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): Two examples.
Dan Senor (role: for): One of the rationales that Bush used for going into Afghanistan is that Pakistan could follow and has its hands on nuclear weapons and those nuclear weapons could get in the wrong hands.

Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I mean I wasn't referring at that point-- at that point, we were in a position in Afghanistan, and there is an issue, a connection between Afghanistan and Pakistan as we all know.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): Because they do have 120 or whatever the number of nuclear weapons they have, and that is the worst thing that would happen if they fall into the wrong hands.

Dan Senor (role: for): Then you're arguing that we're already in decline.
Dan Senor (role: for): And I would say that when you have a situation where leaders around the world, allies of ours, historic allies are openly calling us naive and questioning our commitment, and our loyalty, that will spell American decline because we can't do this on our own.
Dan Senor (role: for): You know, I agree with you that George W. Bush was extremely-- I'll be the first to admit, unpopular around the world.
Dan Senor (role: for): But one thing President Bush did have is very deep relationships with leaders, Aznar in Spain, Harper in Canada, Howard in Australia, Blair in the U.K., Sharon in Israel.
Dan Senor (role: for): Hold on.
Dan Senor (role: for): And that was an enormous mistake.
Dan Senor (role: for): So that was a big mistake by Bush, and I'm glad he ultimately agreed to move off that outreach to Russia.
Dan Senor (role: for): Blair, Berlusconi, Howard, Harper-- these leaders stood by Bush through thick and thin, even though their populations despised him.
Dan Senor (role: for): One leader around the world that is so moved by his speeches and so moved by the press release he put out saying that Pakistan has terrorists in it, point one leader that is willing to stand by him and who he has a very close alliance.

John Donvan (role: mod): These have been two arguments against your point that the personal relationships are critical.
Dan Senor (role: for): It is clear that political leaders make decisions based on the domestic political situation.
Dan Senor (role: for): Two: security matters.
Dan Senor (role: for): And it was because not of some personal emotional relationship that they had with President Bush.
Dan Senor (role: for): Their sense of loyalty to President Bush was because of his commitment to them and his commitment to the security of their country which is what they ultimately care about and his commitment to security abroad.
Dan Senor (role: for): You say Tony Blair was trapped.
Dan Senor (role: for): To this day, he defends the decisions he made.

Dan Senor (role: for): In fact, several of the leaders I cited lost their elections because of their commitment to standing with the United States under President Bush.

Dan Senor (role: for): I’m sorry if my American accent, I wasn’t able to make my point clear.

Dan Senor (role: for): Policy makers make policy, and I don’t see a single policy maker in the world today despite the millions of people who have this affection for President Obama, which I think is heartfelt; I don’t see a single policy maker that is willing to stand up and go toe to toe and lock arms with this president.

Dan Senor (role: for): It was a humiliating experience.
Dan Senor (role: for): The Chinese were allowed to choose who could attend this speech.
Dan Senor (role: for): Normally when presidents go, even if they intend to somewhat humiliate the president, they at least give them a couple of crumbs to leave with.
Dan Senor (role: for): Here we are today, Iran is on the cusp of developing a nuclear weapon and China still won’t support sanctions on the U.N. Security Council, still won’t support sanctions.

John Donvan (role: mod): Response from the other side?
Wesley Clark (role: against): First of all, I’m not going to go into the details of the president’s trip to China except to say that our relationship with the Chinese is one of mutual need.

Mort Zuckerman (role: for): In terms of the way political decisions and political power is exercised, I would ask you to think, if I may, do you think that the ability to speak is influencing the way political decisions are made in those parts of the world where we are trying to influence?
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): Do we think that we are getting through to the leadership because Obama gives speeches?
John Donvan (role: mod): So you do not think he's respected?
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): No, I think he is respected.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I don't think he is effective.
John Donvan (role: mod): To the other side.
John Donvan (role: mod): Wesley Clark.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I think he is effective.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I think what he's done first is set up a base of public understanding for his values and America's values, and his vision.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And I think he's very effectively captured world opinion on that.
Wesley Clark (role: against): He's, then, set about restoring the relationship with allies, fulfilling his responsibilities to protect the United States which he's done, and then trying to work to head off the greatest challenges we face.
Wesley Clark (role: against): So for example, you were talking about nuclear weapons, Mort.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And he called together a nuclear non proliferation summit in Washington.
Wesley Clark (role: against): People came.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And it was important.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And it was a private meeting.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And they came because they respect him and they respect what he stands for in the United States of America.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I think most of us would agree that the greatest single threat we face right now is a nuclear weapon in the hands of terrorists.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And that's the problem Barack Obama is focusing on.
Wesley Clark (role: against): So I give him high marks for the summit.
Wesley Clark (role: against): I give him high marks for moving ahead with the symbolism of a start agreement with Russia to reduce levels of nuclear weapons.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And I give him high marks for the general focus that he's brought to bear on looking to prevent future problems from emerging.
John Donvan (role: mod): Dan Senor.
Dan Senor (role: for): Yeah, I would just say that the fear of nuclear weapons getting to the hands of terrorists is not really an abstract debate.
Dan Senor (role: for): I mean Iran, according to IAEA, according to our own intelligence community Iran will have some sort of nuclear weapon, some sort of breakout capacity very soon: two years, three years.
Dan Senor (role: for): That’s really quick, 2015 perhaps, 2016.
Dan Senor (role: for): We still don’t have a Security Council resolution despite high approval, public opinion approval of President Obama around the world.
Dan Senor (role: for): The Chinese won’t get on board, the Russians won’t get on board.
Dan Senor (role: for): The Iranians basically say and the IEAE says, that Iran has mastered something like 3000 centrifuges, enough to actually build a weapon.
Dan Senor (role: for): I mean, speeches and personal biography and personal charisma are wonderful, they’re nice; I think people around the world like us.
Dan Senor (role: for): I think they’re just limited commodities in foreign affairs.
Dan Senor (role: for): Nations--
John Donvan (role: mod): You’re saying the goodwill does not translate.

Mort Zuckerman (role: for): And there you have, I think, a couple of countries, and a couple of movements that are really threatening a lot of our allies, Iran being one.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): For Syria to have just provided scud missiles or their equivalent to Hezbollah is changing the whole military context of the region.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): And I don't dismiss entirely the rhetoric of the president.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I don't want to diminish what the value of rhetoric is.
John Donvan (role: mod): Wesley Clark just talked about a concrete move of putting more troops into Afghanistan.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I don't disagree with that.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): If there was a rationale for going into Afghanistan, it is to make sure that Pakistan does not collapse.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): So in a sense, we are protecting Pakistan and all of that.
Mort Zuckerman (role: for): I'm not saying that everything he's done is wrong.
John Donvan (role: mod): Our motion is “Obama's foreign policy spells America's decline,” and in arguing for this motion, are you saying that decline has begun already, we're in it?
Dan Senor (role: for): I think the prospect of decline is real.
John Donvan (role: mod): What is the--
Dan Senor (role: for): As General Clark and Bernard said-- General Clark in his opening statement said that America was in decline when Obama took over, that we were in a deep hole.
Dan Senor (role: for): And the question is now is Obama slowing it down?
Dan Senor (role: for): And I want to ask a question.
Dan Senor (role: for): He got much bigger crowds opposing him traveling around the world than Barack Obama gets supporting him.
Wesley Clark (role: against): And Putin in Russia.
Dan Senor (role: for): Hold on.
Dan Senor (role: for): And by the way, he basically stood by Georgia when Georgia went to war with Russia because of Russia's provocation.
Dan Senor (role: for): But you look at these leaders.
Dan Senor (role: for): I ask you to-- tell me one leader today that has that kind of relationship with Obama.

Bernard-Henri Lévy (role: against): More important than Sarkozy is that you have, as you know, an annual poll judging the big leaders of the world.

Evan Wolfson (role: against): Gay people are not saying, ""Let's have no rules and lets have everything happen.""
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Kenji Yoshino.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our motion is ""The Equal Protection Clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages.
John Donvan (role: mod): ""Now we move on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): And round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you, our live audience here in Philadelphia.
John Donvan (role: mod): Our motion is ""The Equal Protection Clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages.""
John Donvan (role: mod): Arguing in support of this motion, we've heard from John Eastman and Sherif Girgis.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have argued that the Constitution does not actually settle this issue.
John Donvan (role: mod): It is not explicit at all, but they argue that the traditional vision of marriage, which they use the term ""conjugal,"" that that vision has historical roots that need to be respected, that in fact the Equal Protection Clause is only to be summoned in situations, very rare instances when majority rule needs to be asserted, but that this is not one of those cases.
John Donvan (role: mod): They also make the point that, repeatedly, when the court has addressed the issue of marriages of fundamental right, it has made it clear that the court, in the court's opinion, that is marriage between one man and one woman.
John Donvan (role: mod): Arguing against them, we have heard from Evan Wolfson and Kenji Yoshino.
John Donvan (role: mod): They argue that, look, it's very simple.
John Donvan (role: mod): The freedom to marry is the freedom to marry.
John Donvan (role: mod): They site the fact that there are 60 percent support in polls for single sex marriage and argue that given historical disadvantage of gay people, that only willful blindness would allow the perception that same-sex marriage is not constitutionally protected.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they go back into history to the time in 1868 when the Equal Protection Clause was written into the 14th amendment, pointing out that they believe that it was left unspecified-- left to future generations to decide what equality was going to mean.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go to the team arguing against the motion which in this case means that you actually are arguing that the Constitution supports and requires states to license same- sex marriage.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponents are saying that by citing the Equal Protection Clause, you can only do so by fundamentally redefining marriage, and in doing so, actually creating a new right.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to ask you to respond to that.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): Yeah.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I would say that we're not asking for a new right.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): We are a new group asking for access to an existing right.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, for example, if we look at Loving v. Virginia, or Turner v. Safley, which my friend and colleague Evan Wolfson referred to, those are cases pertaining to interracial marriage and inmate marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): However, when those plaintiffs sought the right to marry, they did not seek the specific right to interracial marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): They did not seek the specific right to inmate marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): They sought the right to marry.
John Donvan (role: mod): John Eastman, you want to respond?
John Eastman (role: for): Yeah, I do.
John Eastman (role: for): Look, because the test the Supreme Court has developed for addressing these equal protection questions is whether the groups are similarly situated, you have to be adopting a view of marriage in which the groups are similarly situated to make that claim.
John Eastman (role: for): And you necessarily have to be rejecting the view of marriage in which the groups are quite obviously not similarly situated.
John Eastman (role: for): And it's that change in the understanding of the purpose of the institution of marriage that requires us to treat this as a new claim rather than just access to the existing institution.
John Donvan (role: mod): John, just for clarity, what do you mean-- just if you can be more concrete about the sense of ""similarly situated.""
John Eastman (role: for): Yeah.
John Eastman (role: for): So-- any two adult relationships are similarly situated if the purpose of the relationship is to foster the love and commitment between the relationships.
John Eastman (role: for): And if that's what the purpose of marriage was, then I would say it violates equal protection not to extend same-sex marriage to-- or not to extend marriage to same-sex couples, to polyamorous or polygamous couples, to consenting adults in familiar relationship of all sorts.
John Eastman (role: for): If instead the purpose is this unique biological complementarity of men and women that bring men and women together for the purpose of producing the children that are the result of that union, then two men are not capable of having-- women, you're saying you're fertile, that's right, but not-- you know, Kenji says at some point in his book, ""To say that only men can be fathers and only women can be mothers is to engage in sex stereotyping.""
John Eastman (role: for): No, it's not.
John Eastman (role: for): It goes to the very essence of the difference between men and women on this core biological purpose.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me bring it to-- yeah, let me bring it to Evan Wolfson.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): Well, very quickly to that, people marry for many reasons, and we do not dictate-- we do not have the government dictating to you why you marry the person you love and what your marriage needs to be about.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): For many people it is about procreating.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): For many people it isn't.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): For many people it's about raising children, gay and non-gay parents raising their kids.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And for many people it's not about raising kids at all.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): There are many reasons why people marry.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And in this free society, that belonged-- that choice belongs to us, not to the government, and government is not to be used as a weapon to impose one ideological view on everyone else.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): But I want to go back to your question, John, where you talked about this question of a new right.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): You know, from 1776 until 1948 not a single court in the country was willing to strike down restrictions on people seeking to marry someone of, quote, unquote, ""the wrong sex.""
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And finally in 1948 the California Supreme Court, John Eastman's state-- I'm not sure how you felt about it-- but John Eastman's state said that-- struck down race restrictions on marriage.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And what the court said in that case was, ""The essence of the freedom to marry is the right to marry the person who is precious to you.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): People are not interchangeable,"" the court said, ""like trains.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): It's not like if someone else goes-- one goes by and you're not allowed to marry that one, you'll just marry the next one.""
Evan Wolfson (role: against): Gay people share the same interest in marrying the person who is precious to us without arbitrary restriction by the government because that's what the freedom to marry is all about.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And that's not a new right, that's the right that we as Americans have, and it's the right that gay people seek to share.
John Donvan (role: mod): Sherif Girgis, I'll come to you one last time on this question of whether it's a new right or not.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): No.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I mean, of course it's a new right.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I mean, it's basically changing the understanding of marriage in order to say that same-sex couples are similarly situated.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I mean-- so the answer to Professor Yoshino's question is of course the Equal Protection Clause applies to everybody.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): If a gay person walking into this building-- is this a state-run institution-- if it were and a gay person were charged one cent more, however trivial the cost, that's an Equal Protection violation.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): That's not what we're talking about.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): That just basically runs right over the question of what marriage is.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And here's a clear way to put it.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I want to know by what principle Professor Yoshino or Evan Wolfson would say, ""Look, if someone says to you""-- and there are people who say this now-- ""'There are three of us, we're three men, we've thrown our lot in for the long haul, we're committed to it through thick and thin'-- "" and here's why, it's not because-- you say, ""Oh, well, it's perfectly substituted.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): You can settle for one.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): They say, ""No, for our identity.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): That doesn't work.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): It's not the most fulfilling bond.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Surely the principle is recognition of the relationship in which you find most personal fulfillment.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): We don't want to be stigmatized.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): We don't want our kids stigmatized.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): We've been forced into the closet partly because of the gay marriage progress, because we're an embarrassment to the movement, but now we want our turn.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): What is the answer to that?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): commitment--
Evan Wolfson (role: against): I'm astonished it took them that long to go there because whenever somebody starts talking about polygamy or all this other stuff, it means they do not have an answer to the question that's on the table.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): What gay people are saying is, ""Let us have what you have.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 0.0, 'undecided_for': 4.0, 'for_against': 5.0, 'for_for': 9.0, 'undecided_against': 25.0, 'for_undecided': 0.0, 'undecided_undecided': 3.0, 'against_undecided': 1.0, 'against_against': 53.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 3.0, 'for': 14.0, 'against': 83.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 34.0, 'for': 13.0, 'against': 53.0}}",John Donvan,mod,"Are you, however, then to some degree calling upon tradition?"

John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Eastman (role: for): It goes to the very essence of the difference between men and women on this core biological purpose.
John Eastman (role: for): No, it's not.
John Eastman (role: for): If instead the purpose is this unique biological complementarity of men and women that bring men and women together for the purpose of producing the children that are the result of that union, then two men are not capable of having-- women, you're saying you're fertile, that's right, but not-- you know, Kenji says at some point in his book, ""To say that only men can be fathers and only women can be mothers is to engage in sex stereotyping.""
John Eastman (role: for): And if that's what the purpose of marriage was, then I would say it violates equal protection not to extend same-sex marriage to-- or not to extend marriage to same-sex couples, to polyamorous or polygamous couples, to consenting adults in familiar relationship of all sorts.
John Eastman (role: for): So-- any two adult relationships are similarly situated if the purpose of the relationship is to foster the love and commitment between the relationships.
John Eastman (role: for): Yeah.
John Donvan (role: mod): John, just for clarity, what do you mean-- just if you can be more concrete about the sense of ""similarly situated.""
John Eastman (role: for): And it's that change in the understanding of the purpose of the institution of marriage that requires us to treat this as a new claim rather than just access to the existing institution.
John Eastman (role: for): And you necessarily have to be rejecting the view of marriage in which the groups are quite obviously not similarly situated.
John Eastman (role: for): Look, because the test the Supreme Court has developed for addressing these equal protection questions is whether the groups are similarly situated, you have to be adopting a view of marriage in which the groups are similarly situated to make that claim.
John Eastman (role: for): Yeah, I do.
John Donvan (role: mod): John Eastman, you want to respond?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): They sought the right to marry.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): They did not seek the specific right to inmate marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): However, when those plaintiffs sought the right to marry, they did not seek the specific right to interracial marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, for example, if we look at Loving v. Virginia, or Turner v. Safley, which my friend and colleague Evan Wolfson referred to, those are cases pertaining to interracial marriage and inmate marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): We are a new group asking for access to an existing right.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I would say that we're not asking for a new right.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): Yeah.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to ask you to respond to that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponents are saying that by citing the Equal Protection Clause, you can only do so by fundamentally redefining marriage, and in doing so, actually creating a new right.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go to the team arguing against the motion which in this case means that you actually are arguing that the Constitution supports and requires states to license same- sex marriage.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they go back into history to the time in 1868 when the Equal Protection Clause was written into the 14th amendment, pointing out that they believe that it was left unspecified-- left to future generations to decide what equality was going to mean.
John Donvan (role: mod): They site the fact that there are 60 percent support in polls for single sex marriage and argue that given historical disadvantage of gay people, that only willful blindness would allow the perception that same-sex marriage is not constitutionally protected.
John Donvan (role: mod): The freedom to marry is the freedom to marry.
John Donvan (role: mod): They argue that, look, it's very simple.
John Donvan (role: mod): Arguing against them, we have heard from Evan Wolfson and Kenji Yoshino.
John Donvan (role: mod): They also make the point that, repeatedly, when the court has addressed the issue of marriages of fundamental right, it has made it clear that the court, in the court's opinion, that is marriage between one man and one woman.
John Donvan (role: mod): It is not explicit at all, but they argue that the traditional vision of marriage, which they use the term ""conjugal,"" that that vision has historical roots that need to be respected, that in fact the Equal Protection Clause is only to be summoned in situations, very rare instances when majority rule needs to be asserted, but that this is not one of those cases.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have argued that the Constitution does not actually settle this issue.
John Donvan (role: mod): Arguing in support of this motion, we've heard from John Eastman and Sherif Girgis.
John Donvan (role: mod): Our motion is ""The Equal Protection Clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages.""
John Donvan (role: mod): And round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you, our live audience here in Philadelphia.
John Donvan (role: mod): ""Now we move on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our motion is ""The Equal Protection Clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Kenji Yoshino.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): Gay people are not saying, ""Let's have no rules and lets have everything happen.""

Evan Wolfson (role: against): Well, very quickly to that, people marry for many reasons, and we do not dictate-- we do not have the government dictating to you why you marry the person you love and what your marriage needs to be about.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): For many people it is about procreating.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): For many people it isn't.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): For many people it's about raising children, gay and non-gay parents raising their kids.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And for many people it's not about raising kids at all.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): There are many reasons why people marry.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And in this free society, that belonged-- that choice belongs to us, not to the government, and government is not to be used as a weapon to impose one ideological view on everyone else.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): But I want to go back to your question, John, where you talked about this question of a new right.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): You know, from 1776 until 1948 not a single court in the country was willing to strike down restrictions on people seeking to marry someone of, quote, unquote, ""the wrong sex.""
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And finally in 1948 the California Supreme Court, John Eastman's state-- I'm not sure how you felt about it-- but John Eastman's state said that-- struck down race restrictions on marriage.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And what the court said in that case was, ""The essence of the freedom to marry is the right to marry the person who is precious to you.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): People are not interchangeable,"" the court said, ""like trains.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): It's not like if someone else goes-- one goes by and you're not allowed to marry that one, you'll just marry the next one.""
Evan Wolfson (role: against): Gay people share the same interest in marrying the person who is precious to us without arbitrary restriction by the government because that's what the freedom to marry is all about.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And that's not a new right, that's the right that we as Americans have, and it's the right that gay people seek to share.
John Donvan (role: mod): Sherif Girgis, I'll come to you one last time on this question of whether it's a new right or not.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): No.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I mean, of course it's a new right.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I mean, it's basically changing the understanding of marriage in order to say that same-sex couples are similarly situated.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I mean-- so the answer to Professor Yoshino's question is of course the Equal Protection Clause applies to everybody.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): If a gay person walking into this building-- is this a state-run institution-- if it were and a gay person were charged one cent more, however trivial the cost, that's an Equal Protection violation.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): That's not what we're talking about.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): That just basically runs right over the question of what marriage is.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And here's a clear way to put it.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I want to know by what principle Professor Yoshino or Evan Wolfson would say, ""Look, if someone says to you""-- and there are people who say this now-- ""'There are three of us, we're three men, we've thrown our lot in for the long haul, we're committed to it through thick and thin'-- "" and here's why, it's not because-- you say, ""Oh, well, it's perfectly substituted.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): You can settle for one.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): They say, ""No, for our identity.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): That doesn't work.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): It's not the most fulfilling bond.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Surely the principle is recognition of the relationship in which you find most personal fulfillment.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): We don't want to be stigmatized.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): We don't want our kids stigmatized.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): We've been forced into the closet partly because of the gay marriage progress, because we're an embarrassment to the movement, but now we want our turn.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): What is the answer to that?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): commitment--
Evan Wolfson (role: against): I'm astonished it took them that long to go there because whenever somebody starts talking about polygamy or all this other stuff, it means they do not have an answer to the question that's on the table.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): What gay people are saying is, ""Let us have what you have.
John Donvan (role: mod): Are you, however, then to some degree calling upon tradition?
Evan Wolfson (role: against): I'm not sure where you came to that from what I said, but what I--

John Donvan (role: mod): Let's let Kenji answer that question.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): But let me just begin with one, which is-- you know, where Chief Justice Roberts is going during oral arguments with-- by asking whether this is sex discrimination.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, he asks whether this is sex discrimination.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, when we get to the issue of polygamy, if you have polygamists coming in on the day after the Supreme Court rules, hopefully, in favor of same-sex marriage this June, and they say, ""We want to get married,"" numerocity is not a heightened scrutiny classification in this country, right?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I would go on, just a little bit, to say, you know, Mr. Girgis has written a very, I think, thoughtful book about-- called ""What is Marriage?""
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And essentially, he says that-- three principles of marriage-- one is that there's a kind of mind-body union, which is only attainable, apparently, by heterosexual couples.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And then the third is it that it is monogamous and it is hopefully permanent, right, because I don't think you're against all divorces.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, I go down each one of these, and I say-- well, let me go in reverse order.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think gay couples are just as capable of having children in the same way that adoptive parents who are heterosexual have children.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And with regard to the mind- body union, essentially, what Mr. Girgis says in his book is that a man and a woman-- even if both of them are sterile-- accomplish something in their sexual coitus that is different in kind-- right, not in degree-- from two men having sex with each other, right?","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 0.0, 'undecided_for': 4.0, 'for_against': 5.0, 'for_for': 9.0, 'undecided_against': 25.0, 'for_undecided': 0.0, 'undecided_undecided': 3.0, 'against_undecided': 1.0, 'against_against': 53.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 3.0, 'for': 14.0, 'against': 83.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 34.0, 'for': 13.0, 'against': 53.0}}",John Donvan,mod,"Well, Sherif, would you make that point to a judge?"

John Donvan (role: mod): I'm actually looking for clarification.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): We could have a million different other debates--
Sherif Girgis (role: for): It wasn't an evasion, actually.
John Donvan (role: mod): Sherif Girgis.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I was saying you have a principle by which you say whether people are being excluded unfairly or not.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Then, of course, we could win by stipulation.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And of course we would laugh at them and we can say, ""Oh, go apply it equally.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Not the one person--
Sherif Girgis (role: for): --I find most
Sherif Girgis (role: for): But the relationship--
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): There're so many answers to that.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, if you actually think about the current definition of marriage that you hold, and you say, ""A man can marry a woman but a man cannot marry a man,"" that is spatial sex-discrimination.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I think that on its face, it's very hard to argue that it is not.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, the sex discrimination argument drives a clean wedge in between the argument about what we're keeping intact about marriage and what we're changing about marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): about the marriage debate.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): The second is that it is oriented towards family, right?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think you're against only no-fault divorce.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think gay couples are just as capable of monogamy and of permanence.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, unless you want to denigrate, you know, adoptive parents who are heterosexual, unless you want to denigrate heterosexuals who use assistive reproductive technology-- with the assistance of a sperm donor or an egg donor-- unless you want to denigrate sterile couples, I think that it would be an arbitrary distinction to keep out gay couples simply because they can't procreate internal to the union.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And so, if anyone is stipulating something, or suggesting that something should be given to him simply by fiat or stipulation, I would posit that it is the person who says, ""There's just something categorically different, even in the absence of procreation, about heterosexual sex and coitus that makes it categorically different from homosexual sex.""
John Donvan (role: mod): Would you make-- actually make that argument?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Well, I would say a couple of things about it.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): The reason in the book that we bring up people who had no connection to Judaism or Christianity, had nothing like our modern concept of gay orientation, and made remarkably convergent view of marriage-- the reason we do that is to show that there is a question for the other side that they haven't been able to answer, which is, ""How did that come about?""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And now, there are-- what Professor Yoshino's question shows is that there are ways to describe any view that make it look less plausible.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I can say, ""What's the-- when two men throw their lot in together, and do it for the long haul, and share all the burdens and benefits of common-law what's so special about whether-- what brought them together is that they're two brothers or two best friends, or what brought them together is climax?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): There's a way of describing the views that denigrates it, but that wouldn't be fair to Professor Yoshino, and it wouldn't be fair to mine either.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): He said, ""How can two men not have a bodily union?""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Why is sex integral to bodily union?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And yet, in the book, we develop an Aristotelian account, where it's about coordinated action towards a single, common end that completes and encompasses them both.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 0.0, 'undecided_for': 4.0, 'for_against': 5.0, 'for_for': 9.0, 'undecided_against': 25.0, 'for_undecided': 0.0, 'undecided_undecided': 3.0, 'against_undecided': 1.0, 'against_against': 53.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 3.0, 'for': 14.0, 'against': 83.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 34.0, 'for': 13.0, 'against': 53.0}}",John Donvan,mod,Let me-- I'm going to let Evan respond to that.

Sherif Girgis<for>: Co-Author, What Is Marriage?
Evan Wolfson<against>: Founder & President, Freedom to Marry & Author, Why Marriage Matters
Kenji Yoshino<against>: Professor, NYU Law & Author, Speak Now: Marriage Equality on Trial","Sherif Girgis (role: for): But the relationship--
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): There're so many answers to that.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, if you actually think about the current definition of marriage that you hold, and you say, ""A man can marry a woman but a man cannot marry a man,"" that is spatial sex-discrimination.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I think that on its face, it's very hard to argue that it is not.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, the sex discrimination argument drives a clean wedge in between the argument about what we're keeping intact about marriage and what we're changing about marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): about the marriage debate.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): The second is that it is oriented towards family, right?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think you're against only no-fault divorce.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think gay couples are just as capable of monogamy and of permanence.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, unless you want to denigrate, you know, adoptive parents who are heterosexual, unless you want to denigrate heterosexuals who use assistive reproductive technology-- with the assistance of a sperm donor or an egg donor-- unless you want to denigrate sterile couples, I think that it would be an arbitrary distinction to keep out gay couples simply because they can't procreate internal to the union.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And so, if anyone is stipulating something, or suggesting that something should be given to him simply by fiat or stipulation, I would posit that it is the person who says, ""There's just something categorically different, even in the absence of procreation, about heterosexual sex and coitus that makes it categorically different from homosexual sex.""
John Donvan (role: mod): Would you make-- actually make that argument?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Well, I would say a couple of things about it.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): The reason in the book that we bring up people who had no connection to Judaism or Christianity, had nothing like our modern concept of gay orientation, and made remarkably convergent view of marriage-- the reason we do that is to show that there is a question for the other side that they haven't been able to answer, which is, ""How did that come about?""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And now, there are-- what Professor Yoshino's question shows is that there are ways to describe any view that make it look less plausible.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I can say, ""What's the-- when two men throw their lot in together, and do it for the long haul, and share all the burdens and benefits of common-law what's so special about whether-- what brought them together is that they're two brothers or two best friends, or what brought them together is climax?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): There's a way of describing the views that denigrates it, but that wouldn't be fair to Professor Yoshino, and it wouldn't be fair to mine either.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): He said, ""How can two men not have a bodily union?""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Why is sex integral to bodily union?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And yet, in the book, we develop an Aristotelian account, where it's about coordinated action towards a single, common end that completes and encompasses them both.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me-- I'm going to let Evan respond to that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Not-- no.
John Donvan (role: mod): Not wildly off.
John Donvan (role: mod): I'm trying to herd you back in there.
John Donvan (role: mod): But let me let Evan respond.
John Donvan (role: mod): But I want to try to return to the constitution.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): The idea of marriage, the concept of marriage, the rules of marriage were so completely foreign to anything we as Americans, particularly under our Constitution will tolerate.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): I mean, the ownership of the procreative rights and the ability to alienate or even kill your own children.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And so it's just sort of ironic to hear that exalted when actually the very plain words of our Constitution guaranteeing equality and the multiple cases talking about the freedom to marry and the evident humanity of gay people seeking that freedom to marry for the same mix of reasons, some of which may have to do with children, but many of which don't and they are yet equally important and valid.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And apparently, you’re-- willing to overlook a lot in the Constitution if you want to deny something important to gay people.
John Donvan (role: mod): John Eastman, I want to-- I want to take a question to you, or are you dying to respond?
John Eastman (role: for): I’ll figure out a way to respond--
John Donvan (role: mod): You can save it for your two-minute closing.
John Donvan (role: mod): And you've made the argument that this is a matter that should be left up to state legislatures because it doesn't trigger that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Why not?
John Eastman (role: for): And Evan has done a very nice job in turning this to why adults enter into the institution of marriage.
John Eastman (role: for): The question is, why did the state get involved in the marriage business in the first place.
John Eastman (role: for): The state has no interest or business, quite frankly, in getting involved in the institution of marriage for those purposes.
John Eastman (role: for): And that's-- you know, and you go back to the Greeks and every-- it's not just the Greeks and the Romans, it's every society in human history that's come up with the same thing.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 0.0, 'undecided_for': 4.0, 'for_against': 5.0, 'for_for': 9.0, 'undecided_against': 25.0, 'for_undecided': 0.0, 'undecided_undecided': 3.0, 'against_undecided': 1.0, 'against_against': 53.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 3.0, 'for': 14.0, 'against': 83.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 34.0, 'for': 13.0, 'against': 53.0}}",John Donvan,mod,"John, my question is a little bit different."

Sherif Girgis (role: for): First of all, you know, you disparaged the Greeks and the Romans earlier.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): There wasn't religion or it wasn't bigotry.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): But I can do that from a revisionist view, too.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): What's so morally significant about orgasm?""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Let me just take one dimension of the questions that he brought.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Well, here's the question.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Everybody in the debate agrees that somehow, if it's just about fostering and expressing affection, and vulnerability, and tenderness, than other activities can do that.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And that's why the kind of union that a man and a woman can have is different in that respect.
John Donvan (role: mod): I feel that we're losing our constitutional filter, to some degree.
John Donvan (role: mod): No.
John Donvan (role: mod): That's why I'm asking ""Would you say these things to a judge?""
John Donvan (role: mod): You didn't pick up on it.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): Well--
Evan Wolfson (role: against): Well, to try to bring it back to the Constitution, but from where Mr. Girgis just left it, the-- the Greeks' and the Romans' conception of marriage, not to mention many others in between, is not one unified history-- historical embodiment of what you're talking about that suddenly is changing.

John Eastman (role: for): And that's-- and who decides that question I think is the real critical one.

Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So I think the hidden irony of this is that if we were to take that trial court judge's word, Europeans would all have to go back to Europe or Caucasians will have to go back to Europe, and I would have to go back to Asia and so on and so forth.

Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And to me, that's what he's saying.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So I don't think that there's one vision of marriage that the Equal Protection Clause is impermeable to and another vision of marriage to which it speaks.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And just to make a final point here, I haven't heard anything yet about adoptive parents or about sterile couples or about couples that use this reproductive technology or heterosexuals.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): If procreation is so central to the definition of marriage, why would you allow individuals who could not procreate and were demonstratively unable to procreate or unwilling to procreate if they chose not to procreate when they were younger.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I do, yes.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): So, first of all, the interracial marriage thing is a red herring.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): It was in the colonial United States.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Why?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): It was clearly-- now, you look at the history, it's impossible to conclude that it was about anything about oppressing marriages.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And Justice Sotomayor herself has written, in a recent case, ""It's a principle recognized in our cases that the biological bond between a parent and child is meaningful.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): ""Enlarging the concept to embrace same-sex couples would necessarily transform the institution into something new.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Now, on the last point, of course, no matter what your marriage policy is, artificial reproductive technology no matter what your policy is, there will be households in which kids are being reared without a marriage at the head of the household on their vision as well.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I say if there are concrete needs that are arise wherever kids are in a home, you need to make a policy available wherever kids are in a home, whether it's a mom and her mom who moved in to help her raise the kid because she's a single mom, which is the most common kind of same-sex parent-led household or otherwise.

Evan Wolfson<against>: Founder & President, Freedom to Marry & Author, Why Marriage Matters
Kenji Yoshino<against>: Professor, NYU Law & Author, Speak Now: Marriage Equality on Trial","Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, if you're only applying rational basis review, you ask the other side what are your even conceivable justifications-- right?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I want to make another point, though, about the equal protection clause, to be responsive to something that Mr. Girgis said, about how is it that organizations or cultures-- cultures, really-- that were very progressive with regard to gay rights, at least on the surface, nonetheless were opposed to same-sex marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, I would say, this often takes, I think, the more plausible form-- and that's not a knock.
John Donvan (role: mod): Can you give everybody-- the term animus came up earlier.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): Yeah.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): It means ""moral disapproval"" of a particular group.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I would actually be interested in hearing both of my parties opposite.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I think that's a relevant issue because not under the animus, torch-wielding villagers, you know, ""You're a terrible people,"" kind of thing, but just simple moral disapproval, which is the only Constitutional standard that we need in order to cite down this ban, whether or not you have that--
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): Yeah, but let me-- let me tell
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): Because I think that when you run out of arguments in Constitutional law, what's left is the residue.
John Eastman (role: for): John, we've offered lots of rationales.
John Eastman (role: for): Here’s what was said when the North Carolina statute was proposed.
John Eastman (role: for): Two men do not make a mom, two moms do not make a dad.
John Eastman (role: for): Now, I'm going to quote that other real radical conservative on the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg in the VMI case—Professor Yoshino earlier, “physical differences between men and women, however, are enduring.
John Eastman (role: for): A community made up exclusively of one sex is different from a community composed of both.
John Eastman (role: for): But the states' interest in furthering that institution for that purpose is why we are here and
John Eastman (role: for): It's completely irrelevant whether I think gay sex and heterosexual sex are on a moral, similar plane or not, it's irrelevant to the--
John Eastman (role: for): It's completely irrelevant to the Constitutional question.
John Eastman (role: for): The issue is under rational basis review, Professor Yoshino, as you under-- know the issue is whether there is any plausible explanation that is it rational.
John Eastman (role: for): And under rational basis review, that is more than sufficient.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So I've given you one assumption, which is to say, right, let me say, heightened scrutiny does not apply.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So I just want a yes or no question, do you believe that there's something-- this is a policy matter, morally objectionable, about same-sex sexual conduct.

John Donvan (role: mod): And I'm not debating you.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): Right, and what I said is when people try to drag the conversation over to polygamy, it's that they don't have an answer to the question that we're debating tonight, which is, ""What reason does the government have for excluding loving and committed gay couples from what other couples have?""
John Donvan (role: mod): Actually, I--
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I just wanted to come to this point.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Here's what I was saying.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Now, we can just name our principle, we can pick it out of a hat.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I could say, ""Well, my principle is any man and woman as long as one of them has freckles.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I'm asking you why your vision isn't arbitrary compared to this better one.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let--
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's let Kenji answer that question.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): But let me just begin with one, which is-- you know, where Chief Justice Roberts is going during oral arguments with-- by asking whether this is sex discrimination.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, he asks whether this is sex discrimination.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, when we get to the issue of polygamy, if you have polygamists coming in on the day after the Supreme Court rules, hopefully, in favor of same-sex marriage this June, and they say, ""We want to get married,"" numerocity is not a heightened scrutiny classification in this country, right?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I would go on, just a little bit, to say, you know, Mr. Girgis has written a very, I think, thoughtful book about-- called ""What is Marriage?""
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And essentially, he says that-- three principles of marriage-- one is that there's a kind of mind-body union, which is only attainable, apparently, by heterosexual couples.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And then the third is it that it is monogamous and it is hopefully permanent, right, because I don't think you're against all divorces.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, I go down each one of these, and I say-- well, let me go in reverse order.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think gay couples are just as capable of having children in the same way that adoptive parents who are heterosexual have children.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And with regard to the mind- body union, essentially, what Mr. Girgis says in his book is that a man and a woman-- even if both of them are sterile-- accomplish something in their sexual coitus that is different in kind-- right, not in degree-- from two men having sex with each other, right?
John Donvan (role: mod): Well, Sherif, would you make that point to a judge?
John Donvan (role: mod): Well, do you stand by that characterization, and would you actually say, ""Well, in fact, your honor, yes, there is something different, and that's what we're here arguing.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): First of all, you know, you disparaged the Greeks and the Romans earlier.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): There wasn't religion or it wasn't bigotry.

Kenji Yoshino<against>: Professor, NYU Law & Author, Speak Now: Marriage Equality on Trial","Sherif Girgis (role: for): --I find most
Sherif Girgis (role: for): But the relationship--
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): There're so many answers to that.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, if you actually think about the current definition of marriage that you hold, and you say, ""A man can marry a woman but a man cannot marry a man,"" that is spatial sex-discrimination.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I think that on its face, it's very hard to argue that it is not.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, the sex discrimination argument drives a clean wedge in between the argument about what we're keeping intact about marriage and what we're changing about marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): about the marriage debate.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): The second is that it is oriented towards family, right?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think you're against only no-fault divorce.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think gay couples are just as capable of monogamy and of permanence.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, unless you want to denigrate, you know, adoptive parents who are heterosexual, unless you want to denigrate heterosexuals who use assistive reproductive technology-- with the assistance of a sperm donor or an egg donor-- unless you want to denigrate sterile couples, I think that it would be an arbitrary distinction to keep out gay couples simply because they can't procreate internal to the union.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And so, if anyone is stipulating something, or suggesting that something should be given to him simply by fiat or stipulation, I would posit that it is the person who says, ""There's just something categorically different, even in the absence of procreation, about heterosexual sex and coitus that makes it categorically different from homosexual sex.""
John Donvan (role: mod): Would you make-- actually make that argument?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Well, I would say a couple of things about it.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): The reason in the book that we bring up people who had no connection to Judaism or Christianity, had nothing like our modern concept of gay orientation, and made remarkably convergent view of marriage-- the reason we do that is to show that there is a question for the other side that they haven't been able to answer, which is, ""How did that come about?""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And now, there are-- what Professor Yoshino's question shows is that there are ways to describe any view that make it look less plausible.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I can say, ""What's the-- when two men throw their lot in together, and do it for the long haul, and share all the burdens and benefits of common-law what's so special about whether-- what brought them together is that they're two brothers or two best friends, or what brought them together is climax?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): There's a way of describing the views that denigrates it, but that wouldn't be fair to Professor Yoshino, and it wouldn't be fair to mine either.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): He said, ""How can two men not have a bodily union?""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Why is sex integral to bodily union?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And yet, in the book, we develop an Aristotelian account, where it's about coordinated action towards a single, common end that completes and encompasses them both.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me-- I'm going to let Evan respond to that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Not-- no.
John Donvan (role: mod): Not wildly off.
John Donvan (role: mod): I'm trying to herd you back in there.
John Donvan (role: mod): But let me let Evan respond.
John Donvan (role: mod): But I want to try to return to the constitution.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): The idea of marriage, the concept of marriage, the rules of marriage were so completely foreign to anything we as Americans, particularly under our Constitution will tolerate.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): I mean, the ownership of the procreative rights and the ability to alienate or even kill your own children.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And so it's just sort of ironic to hear that exalted when actually the very plain words of our Constitution guaranteeing equality and the multiple cases talking about the freedom to marry and the evident humanity of gay people seeking that freedom to marry for the same mix of reasons, some of which may have to do with children, but many of which don't and they are yet equally important and valid.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And apparently, you’re-- willing to overlook a lot in the Constitution if you want to deny something important to gay people.
John Donvan (role: mod): John Eastman, I want to-- I want to take a question to you, or are you dying to respond?
John Eastman (role: for): I’ll figure out a way to respond--
John Donvan (role: mod): You can save it for your two-minute closing.
John Donvan (role: mod): And you've made the argument that this is a matter that should be left up to state legislatures because it doesn't trigger that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Why not?
John Eastman (role: for): And Evan has done a very nice job in turning this to why adults enter into the institution of marriage.

Sherif Girgis (role: for): Why is sex integral to bodily union?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And yet, in the book, we develop an Aristotelian account, where it's about coordinated action towards a single, common end that completes and encompasses them both.

John Donvan (role: mod): I'm trying to herd you back in there.
John Donvan (role: mod): But let me let Evan respond.
John Donvan (role: mod): But I want to try to return to the constitution.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): The idea of marriage, the concept of marriage, the rules of marriage were so completely foreign to anything we as Americans, particularly under our Constitution will tolerate.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): I mean, the ownership of the procreative rights and the ability to alienate or even kill your own children.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And so it's just sort of ironic to hear that exalted when actually the very plain words of our Constitution guaranteeing equality and the multiple cases talking about the freedom to marry and the evident humanity of gay people seeking that freedom to marry for the same mix of reasons, some of which may have to do with children, but many of which don't and they are yet equally important and valid.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And apparently, you’re-- willing to overlook a lot in the Constitution if you want to deny something important to gay people.
John Donvan (role: mod): John Eastman, I want to-- I want to take a question to you, or are you dying to respond?
John Eastman (role: for): I’ll figure out a way to respond--
John Donvan (role: mod): You can save it for your two-minute closing.

Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, if you're only applying rational basis review, you ask the other side what are your even conceivable justifications-- right?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I want to make another point, though, about the equal protection clause, to be responsive to something that Mr. Girgis said, about how is it that organizations or cultures-- cultures, really-- that were very progressive with regard to gay rights, at least on the surface, nonetheless were opposed to same-sex marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, I would say, this often takes, I think, the more plausible form-- and that's not a knock.
John Donvan (role: mod): Can you give everybody-- the term animus came up earlier.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): Yeah.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): It means ""moral disapproval"" of a particular group.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I would actually be interested in hearing both of my parties opposite.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I think that's a relevant issue because not under the animus, torch-wielding villagers, you know, ""You're a terrible people,"" kind of thing, but just simple moral disapproval, which is the only Constitutional standard that we need in order to cite down this ban, whether or not you have that--
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): Yeah, but let me-- let me tell
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): Because I think that when you run out of arguments in Constitutional law, what's left is the residue.
John Eastman (role: for): John, we've offered lots of rationales.
John Eastman (role: for): Here’s what was said when the North Carolina statute was proposed.
John Eastman (role: for): Two men do not make a mom, two moms do not make a dad.
John Eastman (role: for): Now, I'm going to quote that other real radical conservative on the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg in the VMI case—Professor Yoshino earlier, “physical differences between men and women, however, are enduring.
John Eastman (role: for): A community made up exclusively of one sex is different from a community composed of both.
John Eastman (role: for): But the states' interest in furthering that institution for that purpose is why we are here and
John Eastman (role: for): It's completely irrelevant whether I think gay sex and heterosexual sex are on a moral, similar plane or not, it's irrelevant to the--
John Eastman (role: for): It's completely irrelevant to the Constitutional question.
John Eastman (role: for): The issue is under rational basis review, Professor Yoshino, as you under-- know the issue is whether there is any plausible explanation that is it rational.
John Eastman (role: for): And under rational basis review, that is more than sufficient.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So I've given you one assumption, which is to say, right, let me say, heightened scrutiny does not apply.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So I just want a yes or no question, do you believe that there's something-- this is a policy matter, morally objectionable, about same-sex sexual conduct.

Sherif Girgis<for>: Co-Author, What Is Marriage?
Evan Wolfson<against>: Founder & President, Freedom to Marry & Author, Why Marriage Matters
Kenji Yoshino<against>: Professor, NYU Law & Author, Speak Now: Marriage Equality on Trial","Kenji Yoshino (role: against): Yeah, so, I think that one of the reasons why we keep collapsing into a policy debate is that we're offering them the lowest level of review possible.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And so, that's why I think we're getting a lot of policy debate and policy questions, because they're producing justifications that are, in my view, inadequate.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, he raised the example of the Greeks.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I mean, Mr. Girgis has made this more plausible argument of how can we argue that in this country, same-sex marriage was the bars on same-sex marriage were not enacted with any kind of animus, given that the gay rights movement wasn't even in existence--
John Donvan (role: mod): Can you just give the one sentence meaning?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): Animus, then, is a term of art in constitutional law.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And it is not-- simply moral disapproval of the bigger group is not sufficient in order to carry the day, with regard to justifying a law.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): You know, I would be very curious to know whether or not you believe-- whether you morally disapprove of same-sex relationships, not same-sex individuals, but whether or not you have moral disapproval of same-sex sexual conduct.
John Donvan (role: mod): Why is it-- again, why is it relevant to what their personal views are?
John Donvan (role: mod): Wait, I just want to send-- why is it relevant what his personal views are as opposed to the Constitutional argument?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And the way that things are reasoned out under rational basis review, is you ask the other side to produce all of their justifications, and then if there’s nothing left, then the idea is there's animus involved, a simple moral disapproval.
John Eastman (role: for): You disagree with them or don't like them, but that doesn't mean they're perfectly valid rationales.
John Eastman (role: for): Moms and dads are not interchangeable.
John Eastman (role: for): Children need both a mother and a father.
John Eastman (role: for): The two sexes are not fungible.
John Eastman (role: for): That's the critical understanding, this natural understanding of marriage, that it brings together the unique biological, rooted in nature complementarity of men and women for a purpose that is different than all of the collateral purposes we often assign to marriage.
John Donvan (role: mod): But, John, what about the gauntlet that was just threw down, asking whether you have moral disapproval, and that's informing your argument--
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): It's Let's say it--
John Eastman (role: for): As it was, to what 6 million or 7 million Californians voted who voted for Proposition 8 thought about that question.
John Eastman (role: for): We have offered several, which you have not rebutted.
John Eastman (role: for): And, quite frankly, because of the compelling interest that the state has in fostering this bond, it meets heightened scrutiny as well.

Kenji Yoshino<against>: Professor, NYU Law & Author, Speak Now: Marriage Equality on Trial","Kenji Yoshino (role: against): They sought the right to marry.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): They did not seek the specific right to inmate marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): However, when those plaintiffs sought the right to marry, they did not seek the specific right to interracial marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, for example, if we look at Loving v. Virginia, or Turner v. Safley, which my friend and colleague Evan Wolfson referred to, those are cases pertaining to interracial marriage and inmate marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): We are a new group asking for access to an existing right.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I would say that we're not asking for a new right.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): Yeah.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to ask you to respond to that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponents are saying that by citing the Equal Protection Clause, you can only do so by fundamentally redefining marriage, and in doing so, actually creating a new right.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go to the team arguing against the motion which in this case means that you actually are arguing that the Constitution supports and requires states to license same- sex marriage.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they go back into history to the time in 1868 when the Equal Protection Clause was written into the 14th amendment, pointing out that they believe that it was left unspecified-- left to future generations to decide what equality was going to mean.
John Donvan (role: mod): They site the fact that there are 60 percent support in polls for single sex marriage and argue that given historical disadvantage of gay people, that only willful blindness would allow the perception that same-sex marriage is not constitutionally protected.
John Donvan (role: mod): The freedom to marry is the freedom to marry.
John Donvan (role: mod): They argue that, look, it's very simple.
John Donvan (role: mod): Arguing against them, we have heard from Evan Wolfson and Kenji Yoshino.
John Donvan (role: mod): They also make the point that, repeatedly, when the court has addressed the issue of marriages of fundamental right, it has made it clear that the court, in the court's opinion, that is marriage between one man and one woman.
John Donvan (role: mod): It is not explicit at all, but they argue that the traditional vision of marriage, which they use the term ""conjugal,"" that that vision has historical roots that need to be respected, that in fact the Equal Protection Clause is only to be summoned in situations, very rare instances when majority rule needs to be asserted, but that this is not one of those cases.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have argued that the Constitution does not actually settle this issue.
John Donvan (role: mod): Arguing in support of this motion, we've heard from John Eastman and Sherif Girgis.
John Donvan (role: mod): Our motion is ""The Equal Protection Clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages.""
John Donvan (role: mod): And round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you, our live audience here in Philadelphia.
John Donvan (role: mod): ""Now we move on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our motion is ""The Equal Protection Clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Kenji Yoshino.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): Gay people are not saying, ""Let's have no rules and lets have everything happen.""

John Donvan (role: mod): You do want to preserve certain traditional aspects, for example, monogamy.

Sherif Girgis (role: for): Not the one person--
Sherif Girgis (role: for): --I find most
Sherif Girgis (role: for): But the relationship--
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): There're so many answers to that.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, if you actually think about the current definition of marriage that you hold, and you say, ""A man can marry a woman but a man cannot marry a man,"" that is spatial sex-discrimination.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I think that on its face, it's very hard to argue that it is not.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, the sex discrimination argument drives a clean wedge in between the argument about what we're keeping intact about marriage and what we're changing about marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): about the marriage debate.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): The second is that it is oriented towards family, right?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think you're against only no-fault divorce.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think gay couples are just as capable of monogamy and of permanence.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, unless you want to denigrate, you know, adoptive parents who are heterosexual, unless you want to denigrate heterosexuals who use assistive reproductive technology-- with the assistance of a sperm donor or an egg donor-- unless you want to denigrate sterile couples, I think that it would be an arbitrary distinction to keep out gay couples simply because they can't procreate internal to the union.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And so, if anyone is stipulating something, or suggesting that something should be given to him simply by fiat or stipulation, I would posit that it is the person who says, ""There's just something categorically different, even in the absence of procreation, about heterosexual sex and coitus that makes it categorically different from homosexual sex.""
John Donvan (role: mod): Would you make-- actually make that argument?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Well, I would say a couple of things about it.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): The reason in the book that we bring up people who had no connection to Judaism or Christianity, had nothing like our modern concept of gay orientation, and made remarkably convergent view of marriage-- the reason we do that is to show that there is a question for the other side that they haven't been able to answer, which is, ""How did that come about?""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And now, there are-- what Professor Yoshino's question shows is that there are ways to describe any view that make it look less plausible.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I can say, ""What's the-- when two men throw their lot in together, and do it for the long haul, and share all the burdens and benefits of common-law what's so special about whether-- what brought them together is that they're two brothers or two best friends, or what brought them together is climax?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): There's a way of describing the views that denigrates it, but that wouldn't be fair to Professor Yoshino, and it wouldn't be fair to mine either.

Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I would go on, just a little bit, to say, you know, Mr. Girgis has written a very, I think, thoughtful book about-- called ""What is Marriage?""

Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And with regard to the mind- body union, essentially, what Mr. Girgis says in his book is that a man and a woman-- even if both of them are sterile-- accomplish something in their sexual coitus that is different in kind-- right, not in degree-- from two men having sex with each other, right?

John Donvan (role: mod): Wait, I just want to send-- why is it relevant what his personal views are as opposed to the Constitutional argument?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And the way that things are reasoned out under rational basis review, is you ask the other side to produce all of their justifications, and then if there’s nothing left, then the idea is there's animus involved, a simple moral disapproval.
John Eastman (role: for): You disagree with them or don't like them, but that doesn't mean they're perfectly valid rationales.
John Eastman (role: for): Moms and dads are not interchangeable.
John Eastman (role: for): Children need both a mother and a father.
John Eastman (role: for): The two sexes are not fungible.
John Eastman (role: for): That's the critical understanding, this natural understanding of marriage, that it brings together the unique biological, rooted in nature complementarity of men and women for a purpose that is different than all of the collateral purposes we often assign to marriage.
John Donvan (role: mod): But, John, what about the gauntlet that was just threw down, asking whether you have moral disapproval, and that's informing your argument--

Kenji Yoshino<against>: Professor, NYU Law & Author, Speak Now: Marriage Equality on Trial","Kenji Yoshino (role: against): But let me just begin with one, which is-- you know, where Chief Justice Roberts is going during oral arguments with-- by asking whether this is sex discrimination.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, he asks whether this is sex discrimination.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, when we get to the issue of polygamy, if you have polygamists coming in on the day after the Supreme Court rules, hopefully, in favor of same-sex marriage this June, and they say, ""We want to get married,"" numerocity is not a heightened scrutiny classification in this country, right?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I would go on, just a little bit, to say, you know, Mr. Girgis has written a very, I think, thoughtful book about-- called ""What is Marriage?""
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And essentially, he says that-- three principles of marriage-- one is that there's a kind of mind-body union, which is only attainable, apparently, by heterosexual couples.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And then the third is it that it is monogamous and it is hopefully permanent, right, because I don't think you're against all divorces.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, I go down each one of these, and I say-- well, let me go in reverse order.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think gay couples are just as capable of having children in the same way that adoptive parents who are heterosexual have children.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And with regard to the mind- body union, essentially, what Mr. Girgis says in his book is that a man and a woman-- even if both of them are sterile-- accomplish something in their sexual coitus that is different in kind-- right, not in degree-- from two men having sex with each other, right?
John Donvan (role: mod): Well, Sherif, would you make that point to a judge?
John Donvan (role: mod): Well, do you stand by that characterization, and would you actually say, ""Well, in fact, your honor, yes, there is something different, and that's what we're here arguing.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): First of all, you know, you disparaged the Greeks and the Romans earlier.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): There wasn't religion or it wasn't bigotry.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): But I can do that from a revisionist view, too.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): What's so morally significant about orgasm?""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Let me just take one dimension of the questions that he brought.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Well, here's the question.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Everybody in the debate agrees that somehow, if it's just about fostering and expressing affection, and vulnerability, and tenderness, than other activities can do that.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And that's why the kind of union that a man and a woman can have is different in that respect.
John Donvan (role: mod): I feel that we're losing our constitutional filter, to some degree.
John Donvan (role: mod): No.
John Donvan (role: mod): That's why I'm asking ""Would you say these things to a judge?""
John Donvan (role: mod): You didn't pick up on it.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): Well--
Evan Wolfson (role: against): Well, to try to bring it back to the Constitution, but from where Mr. Girgis just left it, the-- the Greeks' and the Romans' conception of marriage, not to mention many others in between, is not one unified history-- historical embodiment of what you're talking about that suddenly is changing.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): The subordination of women, the patriarchal domination of the household, including slaves.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): I mean, one could go on and on and on.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): I think it really just shows, if you want to make an argument and you suddenly find something you like in the Greeks and Romans, you're willing to overlook a lot.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Eastman (role: for): No, you can give me the question.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): So-- so the-- we understand the Equal Protection Clause being something that's triggered in relatively extraordinary circumstances, particularly when there's a disadvantaged group of people, sometimes called a class of people.

John Eastman (role: for): And that has nothing to do with, it lays its hands on and gives my dignity because they've given me a marriage license or it sanctions my adult relationship.
John Eastman (role: for): It's this unique procreative ability that does it.
John Eastman (role: for): The leading anthropologist, Claude Levi Strauss, the family, based on a union more or less durable, but socially--
John Donvan (role: mod): Why should this not be decided by judges but decided by legislatures?
John Eastman (role: for): That then requires that I answer a question that the Constitution does not answer: Which view of marriage are we going to have; this adult-centric consent view or the long-standing conjugal view?","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 0.0, 'undecided_for': 4.0, 'for_against': 5.0, 'for_for': 9.0, 'undecided_against': 25.0, 'for_undecided': 0.0, 'undecided_undecided': 3.0, 'against_undecided': 1.0, 'against_against': 53.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 3.0, 'for': 14.0, 'against': 83.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 34.0, 'for': 13.0, 'against': 53.0}}",John Eastman,for,And only if you answer that question on the former is it a violation of equal protection.

Kenji Yoshino<against>: Professor, NYU Law & Author, Speak Now: Marriage Equality on Trial","John Donvan (role: mod): Sherif Girgis, I'll come to you one last time on this question of whether it's a new right or not.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): No.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I mean, of course it's a new right.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I mean, it's basically changing the understanding of marriage in order to say that same-sex couples are similarly situated.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I mean-- so the answer to Professor Yoshino's question is of course the Equal Protection Clause applies to everybody.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): If a gay person walking into this building-- is this a state-run institution-- if it were and a gay person were charged one cent more, however trivial the cost, that's an Equal Protection violation.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): That's not what we're talking about.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): That just basically runs right over the question of what marriage is.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And here's a clear way to put it.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I want to know by what principle Professor Yoshino or Evan Wolfson would say, ""Look, if someone says to you""-- and there are people who say this now-- ""'There are three of us, we're three men, we've thrown our lot in for the long haul, we're committed to it through thick and thin'-- "" and here's why, it's not because-- you say, ""Oh, well, it's perfectly substituted.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): You can settle for one.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): They say, ""No, for our identity.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): That doesn't work.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): It's not the most fulfilling bond.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Surely the principle is recognition of the relationship in which you find most personal fulfillment.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): We don't want to be stigmatized.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): We don't want our kids stigmatized.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): We've been forced into the closet partly because of the gay marriage progress, because we're an embarrassment to the movement, but now we want our turn.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): What is the answer to that?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): commitment--
Evan Wolfson (role: against): I'm astonished it took them that long to go there because whenever somebody starts talking about polygamy or all this other stuff, it means they do not have an answer to the question that's on the table.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): What gay people are saying is, ""Let us have what you have.
John Donvan (role: mod): Are you, however, then to some degree calling upon tradition?
Evan Wolfson (role: against): I'm not sure where you came to that from what I said, but what I--
Evan Wolfson (role: against): say is that--
John Donvan (role: mod): And so I'm coming back and saying, ""Huh, well, that sounds as though you are-- you would not support polygamy,"" and that you do not think that, that would be a right, that you actually have--
John Donvan (role: mod): And I'm not debating you.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): Right, and what I said is when people try to drag the conversation over to polygamy, it's that they don't have an answer to the question that we're debating tonight, which is, ""What reason does the government have for excluding loving and committed gay couples from what other couples have?""
John Donvan (role: mod): Actually, I--

Evan Wolfson<against>: Founder & President, Freedom to Marry & Author, Why Marriage Matters
Kenji Yoshino<against>: Professor, NYU Law & Author, Speak Now: Marriage Equality on Trial","Sherif Girgis (role: for): Well, I would say a couple of things about it.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): The reason in the book that we bring up people who had no connection to Judaism or Christianity, had nothing like our modern concept of gay orientation, and made remarkably convergent view of marriage-- the reason we do that is to show that there is a question for the other side that they haven't been able to answer, which is, ""How did that come about?""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And now, there are-- what Professor Yoshino's question shows is that there are ways to describe any view that make it look less plausible.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I can say, ""What's the-- when two men throw their lot in together, and do it for the long haul, and share all the burdens and benefits of common-law what's so special about whether-- what brought them together is that they're two brothers or two best friends, or what brought them together is climax?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): There's a way of describing the views that denigrates it, but that wouldn't be fair to Professor Yoshino, and it wouldn't be fair to mine either.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): He said, ""How can two men not have a bodily union?""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Why is sex integral to bodily union?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And yet, in the book, we develop an Aristotelian account, where it's about coordinated action towards a single, common end that completes and encompasses them both.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me-- I'm going to let Evan respond to that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Not-- no.
John Donvan (role: mod): Not wildly off.
John Donvan (role: mod): I'm trying to herd you back in there.
John Donvan (role: mod): But let me let Evan respond.
John Donvan (role: mod): But I want to try to return to the constitution.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): The idea of marriage, the concept of marriage, the rules of marriage were so completely foreign to anything we as Americans, particularly under our Constitution will tolerate.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): I mean, the ownership of the procreative rights and the ability to alienate or even kill your own children.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And so it's just sort of ironic to hear that exalted when actually the very plain words of our Constitution guaranteeing equality and the multiple cases talking about the freedom to marry and the evident humanity of gay people seeking that freedom to marry for the same mix of reasons, some of which may have to do with children, but many of which don't and they are yet equally important and valid.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And apparently, you’re-- willing to overlook a lot in the Constitution if you want to deny something important to gay people.
John Donvan (role: mod): John Eastman, I want to-- I want to take a question to you, or are you dying to respond?
John Eastman (role: for): I’ll figure out a way to respond--
John Donvan (role: mod): You can save it for your two-minute closing.
John Donvan (role: mod): And you've made the argument that this is a matter that should be left up to state legislatures because it doesn't trigger that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Why not?
John Eastman (role: for): And Evan has done a very nice job in turning this to why adults enter into the institution of marriage.
John Eastman (role: for): The question is, why did the state get involved in the marriage business in the first place.
John Eastman (role: for): The state has no interest or business, quite frankly, in getting involved in the institution of marriage for those purposes.
John Eastman (role: for): And that's-- you know, and you go back to the Greeks and every-- it's not just the Greeks and the Romans, it's every society in human history that's come up with the same thing.
John Donvan (role: mod): John, my question is a little bit different.
John Eastman (role: for): Because the question is, in order to treat them as an equal protection violation, we have to assume that the groups are similarly situated.
John Eastman (role: for): That question is not answered in the Constitution.
John Eastman (role: for): And that's-- and who decides that question I think is the real critical one.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): Yeah, I'm-- I'm a little puzzled by that characterization because, to me, it sounds like if we were debating this back in 1966 in the year before Loving vs. Virginia, it would be like saying, oh, well there are two views of marriage on the table.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So I think the hidden irony of this is that if we were to take that trial court judge's word, Europeans would all have to go back to Europe or Caucasians will have to go back to Europe, and I would have to go back to Asia and so on and so forth.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): But the view is, are we going to choose the vision of marriage that allows for bans on interracial marriage?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And to me, that's what he's saying.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So I don't think that there's one vision of marriage that the Equal Protection Clause is impermeable to and another vision of marriage to which it speaks.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And just to make a final point here, I haven't heard anything yet about adoptive parents or about sterile couples or about couples that use this reproductive technology or heterosexuals.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): If procreation is so central to the definition of marriage, why would you allow individuals who could not procreate and were demonstratively unable to procreate or unwilling to procreate if they chose not to procreate when they were younger.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I do, yes.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): So, first of all, the interracial marriage thing is a red herring.

Evan Wolfson (role: against): --no.
John Donvan (role: mod): I'm actually looking for clarification.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): We could have a million different other debates--
Sherif Girgis (role: for): It wasn't an evasion, actually.
John Donvan (role: mod): Sherif Girgis.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I was saying you have a principle by which you say whether people are being excluded unfairly or not.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Then, of course, we could win by stipulation.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And of course we would laugh at them and we can say, ""Oh, go apply it equally.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Not the one person--
Sherif Girgis (role: for): --I find most
Sherif Girgis (role: for): But the relationship--
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): There're so many answers to that.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, if you actually think about the current definition of marriage that you hold, and you say, ""A man can marry a woman but a man cannot marry a man,"" that is spatial sex-discrimination.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I think that on its face, it's very hard to argue that it is not.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, the sex discrimination argument drives a clean wedge in between the argument about what we're keeping intact about marriage and what we're changing about marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): about the marriage debate.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): The second is that it is oriented towards family, right?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think you're against only no-fault divorce.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think gay couples are just as capable of monogamy and of permanence.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, unless you want to denigrate, you know, adoptive parents who are heterosexual, unless you want to denigrate heterosexuals who use assistive reproductive technology-- with the assistance of a sperm donor or an egg donor-- unless you want to denigrate sterile couples, I think that it would be an arbitrary distinction to keep out gay couples simply because they can't procreate internal to the union.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And so, if anyone is stipulating something, or suggesting that something should be given to him simply by fiat or stipulation, I would posit that it is the person who says, ""There's just something categorically different, even in the absence of procreation, about heterosexual sex and coitus that makes it categorically different from homosexual sex.""
John Donvan (role: mod): Would you make-- actually make that argument?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Well, I would say a couple of things about it.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): The reason in the book that we bring up people who had no connection to Judaism or Christianity, had nothing like our modern concept of gay orientation, and made remarkably convergent view of marriage-- the reason we do that is to show that there is a question for the other side that they haven't been able to answer, which is, ""How did that come about?""

Kenji Yoshino<against>: Professor, NYU Law & Author, Speak Now: Marriage Equality on Trial","Evan Wolfson (role: against): What gay people are saying is, ""Let us have what you have.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): I'm astonished it took them that long to go there because whenever somebody starts talking about polygamy or all this other stuff, it means they do not have an answer to the question that's on the table.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): commitment--
Sherif Girgis (role: for): What is the answer to that?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): We've been forced into the closet partly because of the gay marriage progress, because we're an embarrassment to the movement, but now we want our turn.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): We don't want our kids stigmatized.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): We don't want to be stigmatized.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Surely the principle is recognition of the relationship in which you find most personal fulfillment.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): It's not the most fulfilling bond.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): That doesn't work.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): They say, ""No, for our identity.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): You can settle for one.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I want to know by what principle Professor Yoshino or Evan Wolfson would say, ""Look, if someone says to you""-- and there are people who say this now-- ""'There are three of us, we're three men, we've thrown our lot in for the long haul, we're committed to it through thick and thin'-- "" and here's why, it's not because-- you say, ""Oh, well, it's perfectly substituted.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And here's a clear way to put it.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): That just basically runs right over the question of what marriage is.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): That's not what we're talking about.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): If a gay person walking into this building-- is this a state-run institution-- if it were and a gay person were charged one cent more, however trivial the cost, that's an Equal Protection violation.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I mean-- so the answer to Professor Yoshino's question is of course the Equal Protection Clause applies to everybody.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I mean, it's basically changing the understanding of marriage in order to say that same-sex couples are similarly situated.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I mean, of course it's a new right.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): No.
John Donvan (role: mod): Sherif Girgis, I'll come to you one last time on this question of whether it's a new right or not.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And that's not a new right, that's the right that we as Americans have, and it's the right that gay people seek to share.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): Gay people share the same interest in marrying the person who is precious to us without arbitrary restriction by the government because that's what the freedom to marry is all about.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): It's not like if someone else goes-- one goes by and you're not allowed to marry that one, you'll just marry the next one.""
Evan Wolfson (role: against): People are not interchangeable,"" the court said, ""like trains.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And what the court said in that case was, ""The essence of the freedom to marry is the right to marry the person who is precious to you.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And finally in 1948 the California Supreme Court, John Eastman's state-- I'm not sure how you felt about it-- but John Eastman's state said that-- struck down race restrictions on marriage.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): You know, from 1776 until 1948 not a single court in the country was willing to strike down restrictions on people seeking to marry someone of, quote, unquote, ""the wrong sex.""
Evan Wolfson (role: against): But I want to go back to your question, John, where you talked about this question of a new right.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And in this free society, that belonged-- that choice belongs to us, not to the government, and government is not to be used as a weapon to impose one ideological view on everyone else.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): There are many reasons why people marry.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And for many people it's not about raising kids at all.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): For many people it's about raising children, gay and non-gay parents raising their kids.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): For many people it isn't.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): For many people it is about procreating.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): Well, very quickly to that, people marry for many reasons, and we do not dictate-- we do not have the government dictating to you why you marry the person you love and what your marriage needs to be about.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me bring it to-- yeah, let me bring it to Evan Wolfson.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Eastman (role: for): It goes to the very essence of the difference between men and women on this core biological purpose.
John Eastman (role: for): No, it's not.
John Eastman (role: for): If instead the purpose is this unique biological complementarity of men and women that bring men and women together for the purpose of producing the children that are the result of that union, then two men are not capable of having-- women, you're saying you're fertile, that's right, but not-- you know, Kenji says at some point in his book, ""To say that only men can be fathers and only women can be mothers is to engage in sex stereotyping.""
John Eastman (role: for): And if that's what the purpose of marriage was, then I would say it violates equal protection not to extend same-sex marriage to-- or not to extend marriage to same-sex couples, to polyamorous or polygamous couples, to consenting adults in familiar relationship of all sorts.
John Eastman (role: for): So-- any two adult relationships are similarly situated if the purpose of the relationship is to foster the love and commitment between the relationships.
John Eastman (role: for): Yeah.
John Donvan (role: mod): John, just for clarity, what do you mean-- just if you can be more concrete about the sense of ""similarly situated.""
John Eastman (role: for): And it's that change in the understanding of the purpose of the institution of marriage that requires us to treat this as a new claim rather than just access to the existing institution.
John Eastman (role: for): And you necessarily have to be rejecting the view of marriage in which the groups are quite obviously not similarly situated.
John Eastman (role: for): Look, because the test the Supreme Court has developed for addressing these equal protection questions is whether the groups are similarly situated, you have to be adopting a view of marriage in which the groups are similarly situated to make that claim.
John Eastman (role: for): Yeah, I do.
John Donvan (role: mod): John Eastman, you want to respond?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): They sought the right to marry.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): They did not seek the specific right to inmate marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): However, when those plaintiffs sought the right to marry, they did not seek the specific right to interracial marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, for example, if we look at Loving v. Virginia, or Turner v. Safley, which my friend and colleague Evan Wolfson referred to, those are cases pertaining to interracial marriage and inmate marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): We are a new group asking for access to an existing right.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I would say that we're not asking for a new right.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): Yeah.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to ask you to respond to that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponents are saying that by citing the Equal Protection Clause, you can only do so by fundamentally redefining marriage, and in doing so, actually creating a new right.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go to the team arguing against the motion which in this case means that you actually are arguing that the Constitution supports and requires states to license same- sex marriage.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they go back into history to the time in 1868 when the Equal Protection Clause was written into the 14th amendment, pointing out that they believe that it was left unspecified-- left to future generations to decide what equality was going to mean.
John Donvan (role: mod): They site the fact that there are 60 percent support in polls for single sex marriage and argue that given historical disadvantage of gay people, that only willful blindness would allow the perception that same-sex marriage is not constitutionally protected.
John Donvan (role: mod): The freedom to marry is the freedom to marry.
John Donvan (role: mod): They argue that, look, it's very simple.
John Donvan (role: mod): Arguing against them, we have heard from Evan Wolfson and Kenji Yoshino.
John Donvan (role: mod): They also make the point that, repeatedly, when the court has addressed the issue of marriages of fundamental right, it has made it clear that the court, in the court's opinion, that is marriage between one man and one woman.
John Donvan (role: mod): It is not explicit at all, but they argue that the traditional vision of marriage, which they use the term ""conjugal,"" that that vision has historical roots that need to be respected, that in fact the Equal Protection Clause is only to be summoned in situations, very rare instances when majority rule needs to be asserted, but that this is not one of those cases.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have argued that the Constitution does not actually settle this issue.
John Donvan (role: mod): Arguing in support of this motion, we've heard from John Eastman and Sherif Girgis.
John Donvan (role: mod): Our motion is ""The Equal Protection Clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages.""
John Donvan (role: mod): And round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you, our live audience here in Philadelphia.
John Donvan (role: mod): ""Now we move on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our motion is ""The Equal Protection Clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages.

Evan Wolfson<against>: Founder & President, Freedom to Marry & Author, Why Marriage Matters
Kenji Yoshino<against>: Professor, NYU Law & Author, Speak Now: Marriage Equality on Trial","John Eastman (role: for): I’ll figure out a way to respond--
John Donvan (role: mod): You can save it for your two-minute closing.
John Donvan (role: mod): And you've made the argument that this is a matter that should be left up to state legislatures because it doesn't trigger that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Why not?
John Eastman (role: for): And Evan has done a very nice job in turning this to why adults enter into the institution of marriage.
John Eastman (role: for): The question is, why did the state get involved in the marriage business in the first place.
John Eastman (role: for): The state has no interest or business, quite frankly, in getting involved in the institution of marriage for those purposes.
John Eastman (role: for): And that's-- you know, and you go back to the Greeks and every-- it's not just the Greeks and the Romans, it's every society in human history that's come up with the same thing.
John Donvan (role: mod): John, my question is a little bit different.
John Eastman (role: for): Because the question is, in order to treat them as an equal protection violation, we have to assume that the groups are similarly situated.
John Eastman (role: for): That question is not answered in the Constitution.
John Eastman (role: for): And that's-- and who decides that question I think is the real critical one.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): Yeah, I'm-- I'm a little puzzled by that characterization because, to me, it sounds like if we were debating this back in 1966 in the year before Loving vs. Virginia, it would be like saying, oh, well there are two views of marriage on the table.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So I think the hidden irony of this is that if we were to take that trial court judge's word, Europeans would all have to go back to Europe or Caucasians will have to go back to Europe, and I would have to go back to Asia and so on and so forth.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): But the view is, are we going to choose the vision of marriage that allows for bans on interracial marriage?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And to me, that's what he's saying.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So I don't think that there's one vision of marriage that the Equal Protection Clause is impermeable to and another vision of marriage to which it speaks.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And just to make a final point here, I haven't heard anything yet about adoptive parents or about sterile couples or about couples that use this reproductive technology or heterosexuals.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): If procreation is so central to the definition of marriage, why would you allow individuals who could not procreate and were demonstratively unable to procreate or unwilling to procreate if they chose not to procreate when they were younger.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I do, yes.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): So, first of all, the interracial marriage thing is a red herring.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): It was in the colonial United States.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Why?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): It was clearly-- now, you look at the history, it's impossible to conclude that it was about anything about oppressing marriages.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And Justice Sotomayor herself has written, in a recent case, ""It's a principle recognized in our cases that the biological bond between a parent and child is meaningful.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): ""Enlarging the concept to embrace same-sex couples would necessarily transform the institution into something new.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Now, on the last point, of course, no matter what your marriage policy is, artificial reproductive technology no matter what your policy is, there will be households in which kids are being reared without a marriage at the head of the household on their vision as well.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I say if there are concrete needs that are arise wherever kids are in a home, you need to make a policy available wherever kids are in a home, whether it's a mom and her mom who moved in to help her raise the kid because she's a single mom, which is the most common kind of same-sex parent-led household or otherwise.
John Donvan (role: mod): Do you concede that they-- that's actually accurate?
John Donvan (role: mod): Evan Wolfson.
John Donvan (role: mod): Right.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): No, because we're talking about-- we're talking about the freedom to marry and the question is to whether the freedom to marry can be denied to this group of people, this individual, this couple and the reasons that they bring before the court.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): Well, I don't-- that's not a precedent.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): That's just-- that's just where we-- the record in which we've gotten to right now.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And I just have to say, it's now my turn to be a little puzzled about the reference to children because, again, marriage is not just about children.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 0.0, 'undecided_for': 4.0, 'for_against': 5.0, 'for_for': 9.0, 'undecided_against': 25.0, 'for_undecided': 0.0, 'undecided_undecided': 3.0, 'against_undecided': 1.0, 'against_against': 53.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 3.0, 'for': 14.0, 'against': 83.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 34.0, 'for': 13.0, 'against': 53.0}}",Evan Wolfson,against,"Even Justice Scalia has said that if your argument rests on the procreative argument, your denial of marriage to gay people is on very shaky ground."

Kenji Yoshino<against>: Professor, NYU Law & Author, Speak Now: Marriage Equality on Trial","John Donvan (role: mod): Why should this not be decided by judges but decided by legislatures?
John Eastman (role: for): That then requires that I answer a question that the Constitution does not answer: Which view of marriage are we going to have; this adult-centric consent view or the long-standing conjugal view?
John Eastman (role: for): And only if you answer that question on the former is it a violation of equal protection.
John Donvan (role: mod): Kenji Yoshino.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): One view says that, you know, God put the five races-- this is actual quotation from a trial court judge-- on five different continents, and but for a violation of his will, the races would not have mixed.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So I think, that-- unintended consequences there.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): Or are we going to choose the more inclusive definition of marriage that allows interracial couples access to this existing right?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I do think that the Equal Protection Clause has an answer to that.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think that the Equal Protection Clause speaks to the definition of marriage that we have, right.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, you know, if a 70-year-old and an 80-year-old want to get married, right, why should we allow them to marry under your vision?
John Donvan (role: mod): Do you want to take it, Sherif?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): A couple-- there are a couple points in there.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Do you know where the first place in the world that interracial marriage first came up?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Nancy Cott says this.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Because that was a regime of slavery.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): To believe that there's an analogy here, you would have to believe that biological parenting-- thinking that that matters is on par with thinking that your skin color matters.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): She would never say the same thing about racial purity which is the language of these-- while a second thing, on the idea that this isn't something new, here's a quote.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): ""That is Bill Eskridge, one of the pioneer legal scholars in favor of same-sex marriage and gay rights for 25 years admitting the plain fact and just saying it's a good idea.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): But they want to smuggle this off stage to say that that consideration just for same-sex couples requires just extending it to marriage.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go to audience questions, so I just want to remind you, but before I do it, I just want to put one question to Evan Wolfson to take something back from what your opponent said earlier when they cited, I think 14 cases where they say the Supreme Court, when discussing marriage as a fundamental right, made it clear that it was between a man and a woman.
John Donvan (role: mod): And if so, does it matter?
Evan Wolfson (role: against): Well, it is accurate that those cases that had reached the Supreme Court and triggered the rulings in those cases were not about gay people's freedom to marry, because it's this case that has brought that--
John Donvan (role: mod): But-- but does that mean the silence on-- relative silence means that it would-- necessarily meant one man, one woman?

Sherif Girgis (role: for): It wasn't an evasion, actually.
John Donvan (role: mod): Sherif Girgis.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I was saying you have a principle by which you say whether people are being excluded unfairly or not.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Then, of course, we could win by stipulation.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And of course we would laugh at them and we can say, ""Oh, go apply it equally.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Not the one person--
Sherif Girgis (role: for): --I find most
Sherif Girgis (role: for): But the relationship--
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): There're so many answers to that.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, if you actually think about the current definition of marriage that you hold, and you say, ""A man can marry a woman but a man cannot marry a man,"" that is spatial sex-discrimination.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I think that on its face, it's very hard to argue that it is not.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, the sex discrimination argument drives a clean wedge in between the argument about what we're keeping intact about marriage and what we're changing about marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): about the marriage debate.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): The second is that it is oriented towards family, right?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think you're against only no-fault divorce.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think gay couples are just as capable of monogamy and of permanence.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, unless you want to denigrate, you know, adoptive parents who are heterosexual, unless you want to denigrate heterosexuals who use assistive reproductive technology-- with the assistance of a sperm donor or an egg donor-- unless you want to denigrate sterile couples, I think that it would be an arbitrary distinction to keep out gay couples simply because they can't procreate internal to the union.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And so, if anyone is stipulating something, or suggesting that something should be given to him simply by fiat or stipulation, I would posit that it is the person who says, ""There's just something categorically different, even in the absence of procreation, about heterosexual sex and coitus that makes it categorically different from homosexual sex.""
John Donvan (role: mod): Would you make-- actually make that argument?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Well, I would say a couple of things about it.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): The reason in the book that we bring up people who had no connection to Judaism or Christianity, had nothing like our modern concept of gay orientation, and made remarkably convergent view of marriage-- the reason we do that is to show that there is a question for the other side that they haven't been able to answer, which is, ""How did that come about?""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And now, there are-- what Professor Yoshino's question shows is that there are ways to describe any view that make it look less plausible.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I can say, ""What's the-- when two men throw their lot in together, and do it for the long haul, and share all the burdens and benefits of common-law what's so special about whether-- what brought them together is that they're two brothers or two best friends, or what brought them together is climax?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): There's a way of describing the views that denigrates it, but that wouldn't be fair to Professor Yoshino, and it wouldn't be fair to mine either.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): He said, ""How can two men not have a bodily union?""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Why is sex integral to bodily union?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And yet, in the book, we develop an Aristotelian account, where it's about coordinated action towards a single, common end that completes and encompasses them both.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me-- I'm going to let Evan respond to that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Not-- no.
John Donvan (role: mod): Not wildly off.
John Donvan (role: mod): I'm trying to herd you back in there.
John Donvan (role: mod): But let me let Evan respond.
John Donvan (role: mod): But I want to try to return to the constitution.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): The idea of marriage, the concept of marriage, the rules of marriage were so completely foreign to anything we as Americans, particularly under our Constitution will tolerate.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): I mean, the ownership of the procreative rights and the ability to alienate or even kill your own children.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 0.0, 'undecided_for': 4.0, 'for_against': 5.0, 'for_for': 9.0, 'undecided_against': 25.0, 'for_undecided': 0.0, 'undecided_undecided': 3.0, 'against_undecided': 1.0, 'against_against': 53.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 3.0, 'for': 14.0, 'against': 83.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 34.0, 'for': 13.0, 'against': 53.0}}",Evan Wolfson,against,"And so it's just sort of ironic to hear that exalted when actually the very plain words of our Constitution guaranteeing equality and the multiple cases talking about the freedom to marry and the evident humanity of gay people seeking that freedom to marry for the same mix of reasons, some of which may have to do with children, but many of which don't and they are yet equally important and valid."

Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, unless you want to denigrate, you know, adoptive parents who are heterosexual, unless you want to denigrate heterosexuals who use assistive reproductive technology-- with the assistance of a sperm donor or an egg donor-- unless you want to denigrate sterile couples, I think that it would be an arbitrary distinction to keep out gay couples simply because they can't procreate internal to the union.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And so, if anyone is stipulating something, or suggesting that something should be given to him simply by fiat or stipulation, I would posit that it is the person who says, ""There's just something categorically different, even in the absence of procreation, about heterosexual sex and coitus that makes it categorically different from homosexual sex.""
John Donvan (role: mod): Would you make-- actually make that argument?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Well, I would say a couple of things about it.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): The reason in the book that we bring up people who had no connection to Judaism or Christianity, had nothing like our modern concept of gay orientation, and made remarkably convergent view of marriage-- the reason we do that is to show that there is a question for the other side that they haven't been able to answer, which is, ""How did that come about?""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And now, there are-- what Professor Yoshino's question shows is that there are ways to describe any view that make it look less plausible.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I can say, ""What's the-- when two men throw their lot in together, and do it for the long haul, and share all the burdens and benefits of common-law what's so special about whether-- what brought them together is that they're two brothers or two best friends, or what brought them together is climax?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): There's a way of describing the views that denigrates it, but that wouldn't be fair to Professor Yoshino, and it wouldn't be fair to mine either.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): He said, ""How can two men not have a bodily union?""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Why is sex integral to bodily union?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And yet, in the book, we develop an Aristotelian account, where it's about coordinated action towards a single, common end that completes and encompasses them both.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me-- I'm going to let Evan respond to that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Not-- no.

Sherif Girgis<for>: Co-Author, What Is Marriage?
Evan Wolfson<against>: Founder & President, Freedom to Marry & Author, Why Marriage Matters
Kenji Yoshino<against>: Professor, NYU Law & Author, Speak Now: Marriage Equality on Trial","John Donvan (role: mod): John Eastman, you want to respond?
John Eastman (role: for): Yeah, I do.
John Eastman (role: for): Look, because the test the Supreme Court has developed for addressing these equal protection questions is whether the groups are similarly situated, you have to be adopting a view of marriage in which the groups are similarly situated to make that claim.
John Eastman (role: for): And you necessarily have to be rejecting the view of marriage in which the groups are quite obviously not similarly situated.
John Eastman (role: for): And it's that change in the understanding of the purpose of the institution of marriage that requires us to treat this as a new claim rather than just access to the existing institution.
John Donvan (role: mod): John, just for clarity, what do you mean-- just if you can be more concrete about the sense of ""similarly situated.""
John Eastman (role: for): Yeah.
John Eastman (role: for): So-- any two adult relationships are similarly situated if the purpose of the relationship is to foster the love and commitment between the relationships.
John Eastman (role: for): And if that's what the purpose of marriage was, then I would say it violates equal protection not to extend same-sex marriage to-- or not to extend marriage to same-sex couples, to polyamorous or polygamous couples, to consenting adults in familiar relationship of all sorts.
John Eastman (role: for): If instead the purpose is this unique biological complementarity of men and women that bring men and women together for the purpose of producing the children that are the result of that union, then two men are not capable of having-- women, you're saying you're fertile, that's right, but not-- you know, Kenji says at some point in his book, ""To say that only men can be fathers and only women can be mothers is to engage in sex stereotyping.""
John Eastman (role: for): No, it's not.
John Eastman (role: for): It goes to the very essence of the difference between men and women on this core biological purpose.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me bring it to-- yeah, let me bring it to Evan Wolfson.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): Well, very quickly to that, people marry for many reasons, and we do not dictate-- we do not have the government dictating to you why you marry the person you love and what your marriage needs to be about.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): For many people it is about procreating.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): For many people it isn't.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): For many people it's about raising children, gay and non-gay parents raising their kids.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And for many people it's not about raising kids at all.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): There are many reasons why people marry.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And in this free society, that belonged-- that choice belongs to us, not to the government, and government is not to be used as a weapon to impose one ideological view on everyone else.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): But I want to go back to your question, John, where you talked about this question of a new right.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): You know, from 1776 until 1948 not a single court in the country was willing to strike down restrictions on people seeking to marry someone of, quote, unquote, ""the wrong sex.""
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And finally in 1948 the California Supreme Court, John Eastman's state-- I'm not sure how you felt about it-- but John Eastman's state said that-- struck down race restrictions on marriage.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And what the court said in that case was, ""The essence of the freedom to marry is the right to marry the person who is precious to you.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): People are not interchangeable,"" the court said, ""like trains.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): It's not like if someone else goes-- one goes by and you're not allowed to marry that one, you'll just marry the next one.""
Evan Wolfson (role: against): Gay people share the same interest in marrying the person who is precious to us without arbitrary restriction by the government because that's what the freedom to marry is all about.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): And that's not a new right, that's the right that we as Americans have, and it's the right that gay people seek to share.
John Donvan (role: mod): Sherif Girgis, I'll come to you one last time on this question of whether it's a new right or not.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): No.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I mean, of course it's a new right.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I mean, it's basically changing the understanding of marriage in order to say that same-sex couples are similarly situated.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I mean-- so the answer to Professor Yoshino's question is of course the Equal Protection Clause applies to everybody.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): If a gay person walking into this building-- is this a state-run institution-- if it were and a gay person were charged one cent more, however trivial the cost, that's an Equal Protection violation.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): That's not what we're talking about.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): That just basically runs right over the question of what marriage is.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And here's a clear way to put it.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I want to know by what principle Professor Yoshino or Evan Wolfson would say, ""Look, if someone says to you""-- and there are people who say this now-- ""'There are three of us, we're three men, we've thrown our lot in for the long haul, we're committed to it through thick and thin'-- "" and here's why, it's not because-- you say, ""Oh, well, it's perfectly substituted.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): You can settle for one.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): They say, ""No, for our identity.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): That doesn't work.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): It's not the most fulfilling bond.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Surely the principle is recognition of the relationship in which you find most personal fulfillment.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): We don't want to be stigmatized.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): We don't want our kids stigmatized.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): We've been forced into the closet partly because of the gay marriage progress, because we're an embarrassment to the movement, but now we want our turn.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): What is the answer to that?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): commitment--
Evan Wolfson (role: against): I'm astonished it took them that long to go there because whenever somebody starts talking about polygamy or all this other stuff, it means they do not have an answer to the question that's on the table.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): What gay people are saying is, ""Let us have what you have.
John Donvan (role: mod): Are you, however, then to some degree calling upon tradition?
Evan Wolfson (role: against): I'm not sure where you came to that from what I said, but what I--","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 0.0, 'undecided_for': 4.0, 'for_against': 5.0, 'for_for': 9.0, 'undecided_against': 25.0, 'for_undecided': 0.0, 'undecided_undecided': 3.0, 'against_undecided': 1.0, 'against_against': 53.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 3.0, 'for': 14.0, 'against': 83.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 34.0, 'for': 13.0, 'against': 53.0}}",Evan Wolfson,against,say is that--

Sherif Girgis (role: for): I just wanted to come to this point.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Here's what I was saying.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Now, we can just name our principle, we can pick it out of a hat.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I could say, ""Well, my principle is any man and woman as long as one of them has freckles.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I'm asking you why your vision isn't arbitrary compared to this better one.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let--
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's let Kenji answer that question.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): But let me just begin with one, which is-- you know, where Chief Justice Roberts is going during oral arguments with-- by asking whether this is sex discrimination.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, he asks whether this is sex discrimination.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, when we get to the issue of polygamy, if you have polygamists coming in on the day after the Supreme Court rules, hopefully, in favor of same-sex marriage this June, and they say, ""We want to get married,"" numerocity is not a heightened scrutiny classification in this country, right?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I would go on, just a little bit, to say, you know, Mr. Girgis has written a very, I think, thoughtful book about-- called ""What is Marriage?""
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And essentially, he says that-- three principles of marriage-- one is that there's a kind of mind-body union, which is only attainable, apparently, by heterosexual couples.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And then the third is it that it is monogamous and it is hopefully permanent, right, because I don't think you're against all divorces.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, I go down each one of these, and I say-- well, let me go in reverse order.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think gay couples are just as capable of having children in the same way that adoptive parents who are heterosexual have children.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And with regard to the mind- body union, essentially, what Mr. Girgis says in his book is that a man and a woman-- even if both of them are sterile-- accomplish something in their sexual coitus that is different in kind-- right, not in degree-- from two men having sex with each other, right?
John Donvan (role: mod): Well, Sherif, would you make that point to a judge?
John Donvan (role: mod): Well, do you stand by that characterization, and would you actually say, ""Well, in fact, your honor, yes, there is something different, and that's what we're here arguing.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): First of all, you know, you disparaged the Greeks and the Romans earlier.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): There wasn't religion or it wasn't bigotry.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): But I can do that from a revisionist view, too.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): What's so morally significant about orgasm?""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Let me just take one dimension of the questions that he brought.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Well, here's the question.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Everybody in the debate agrees that somehow, if it's just about fostering and expressing affection, and vulnerability, and tenderness, than other activities can do that.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And that's why the kind of union that a man and a woman can have is different in that respect.
John Donvan (role: mod): I feel that we're losing our constitutional filter, to some degree.
John Donvan (role: mod): No.
John Donvan (role: mod): That's why I'm asking ""Would you say these things to a judge?""
John Donvan (role: mod): You didn't pick up on it.

Sherif Girgis (role: for): It wasn't an evasion, actually.
John Donvan (role: mod): Sherif Girgis.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I was saying you have a principle by which you say whether people are being excluded unfairly or not.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Then, of course, we could win by stipulation.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And of course we would laugh at them and we can say, ""Oh, go apply it equally.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Not the one person--
Sherif Girgis (role: for): --I find most
Sherif Girgis (role: for): But the relationship--
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): There're so many answers to that.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, if you actually think about the current definition of marriage that you hold, and you say, ""A man can marry a woman but a man cannot marry a man,"" that is spatial sex-discrimination.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I think that on its face, it's very hard to argue that it is not.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, the sex discrimination argument drives a clean wedge in between the argument about what we're keeping intact about marriage and what we're changing about marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): about the marriage debate.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): The second is that it is oriented towards family, right?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think you're against only no-fault divorce.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think gay couples are just as capable of monogamy and of permanence.

Sherif Girgis (role: for): I mean, it goes back to this question, you know, the interests-- does the state interests change when the two adults aren't in a romantic bond?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): There's no way of reading the history and thinking this wasn't fundamentally about keeping blacks and whites apart, to keep the whites on top.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Here by contrast, again, it's impossible to look at the history and think the only purpose is to oppress gay people.

Kenji Yoshino<against>: Professor, NYU Law & Author, Speak Now: Marriage Equality on Trial","John Eastman (role: for): I’ll figure out a way to respond--
John Donvan (role: mod): You can save it for your two-minute closing.
John Donvan (role: mod): And you've made the argument that this is a matter that should be left up to state legislatures because it doesn't trigger that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Why not?
John Eastman (role: for): And Evan has done a very nice job in turning this to why adults enter into the institution of marriage.
John Eastman (role: for): The question is, why did the state get involved in the marriage business in the first place.
John Eastman (role: for): The state has no interest or business, quite frankly, in getting involved in the institution of marriage for those purposes.
John Eastman (role: for): And that's-- you know, and you go back to the Greeks and every-- it's not just the Greeks and the Romans, it's every society in human history that's come up with the same thing.
John Donvan (role: mod): John, my question is a little bit different.
John Eastman (role: for): Because the question is, in order to treat them as an equal protection violation, we have to assume that the groups are similarly situated.
John Eastman (role: for): That question is not answered in the Constitution.
John Eastman (role: for): And that's-- and who decides that question I think is the real critical one.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): Yeah, I'm-- I'm a little puzzled by that characterization because, to me, it sounds like if we were debating this back in 1966 in the year before Loving vs. Virginia, it would be like saying, oh, well there are two views of marriage on the table.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So I think the hidden irony of this is that if we were to take that trial court judge's word, Europeans would all have to go back to Europe or Caucasians will have to go back to Europe, and I would have to go back to Asia and so on and so forth.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): But the view is, are we going to choose the vision of marriage that allows for bans on interracial marriage?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And to me, that's what he's saying.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So I don't think that there's one vision of marriage that the Equal Protection Clause is impermeable to and another vision of marriage to which it speaks.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And just to make a final point here, I haven't heard anything yet about adoptive parents or about sterile couples or about couples that use this reproductive technology or heterosexuals.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): If procreation is so central to the definition of marriage, why would you allow individuals who could not procreate and were demonstratively unable to procreate or unwilling to procreate if they chose not to procreate when they were younger.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I do, yes.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): So, first of all, the interracial marriage thing is a red herring.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): It was in the colonial United States.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Why?
Sherif Girgis (role: for): It was clearly-- now, you look at the history, it's impossible to conclude that it was about anything about oppressing marriages.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): And Justice Sotomayor herself has written, in a recent case, ""It's a principle recognized in our cases that the biological bond between a parent and child is meaningful.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): ""Enlarging the concept to embrace same-sex couples would necessarily transform the institution into something new.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Now, on the last point, of course, no matter what your marriage policy is, artificial reproductive technology no matter what your policy is, there will be households in which kids are being reared without a marriage at the head of the household on their vision as well.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I say if there are concrete needs that are arise wherever kids are in a home, you need to make a policy available wherever kids are in a home, whether it's a mom and her mom who moved in to help her raise the kid because she's a single mom, which is the most common kind of same-sex parent-led household or otherwise.
John Donvan (role: mod): Do you concede that they-- that's actually accurate?
John Donvan (role: mod): Evan Wolfson.
John Donvan (role: mod): Right.
Evan Wolfson (role: against): No, because we're talking about-- we're talking about the freedom to marry and the question is to whether the freedom to marry can be denied to this group of people, this individual, this couple and the reasons that they bring before the court.

John Donvan (role: mod): Actually, I--
Sherif Girgis (role: for): I just wanted to come to this point.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Here's what I was saying.
Sherif Girgis (role: for): Now, we can just name our principle, we can pick it out of a hat.

John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let--
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's let Kenji answer that question.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): But let me just begin with one, which is-- you know, where Chief Justice Roberts is going during oral arguments with-- by asking whether this is sex discrimination.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, he asks whether this is sex discrimination.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, when we get to the issue of polygamy, if you have polygamists coming in on the day after the Supreme Court rules, hopefully, in favor of same-sex marriage this June, and they say, ""We want to get married,"" numerocity is not a heightened scrutiny classification in this country, right?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And I would go on, just a little bit, to say, you know, Mr. Girgis has written a very, I think, thoughtful book about-- called ""What is Marriage?""
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And essentially, he says that-- three principles of marriage-- one is that there's a kind of mind-body union, which is only attainable, apparently, by heterosexual couples.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And then the third is it that it is monogamous and it is hopefully permanent, right, because I don't think you're against all divorces.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, I go down each one of these, and I say-- well, let me go in reverse order.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I think gay couples are just as capable of having children in the same way that adoptive parents who are heterosexual have children.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): And with regard to the mind- body union, essentially, what Mr. Girgis says in his book is that a man and a woman-- even if both of them are sterile-- accomplish something in their sexual coitus that is different in kind-- right, not in degree-- from two men having sex with each other, right?
John Donvan (role: mod): Well, Sherif, would you make that point to a judge?
John Donvan (role: mod): Well, do you stand by that characterization, and would you actually say, ""Well, in fact, your honor, yes, there is something different, and that's what we're here arguing.""
Sherif Girgis (role: for): First of all, you know, you disparaged the Greeks and the Romans earlier.

John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Eastman (role: for): It goes to the very essence of the difference between men and women on this core biological purpose.
John Eastman (role: for): No, it's not.
John Eastman (role: for): If instead the purpose is this unique biological complementarity of men and women that bring men and women together for the purpose of producing the children that are the result of that union, then two men are not capable of having-- women, you're saying you're fertile, that's right, but not-- you know, Kenji says at some point in his book, ""To say that only men can be fathers and only women can be mothers is to engage in sex stereotyping.""
John Eastman (role: for): And if that's what the purpose of marriage was, then I would say it violates equal protection not to extend same-sex marriage to-- or not to extend marriage to same-sex couples, to polyamorous or polygamous couples, to consenting adults in familiar relationship of all sorts.
John Eastman (role: for): So-- any two adult relationships are similarly situated if the purpose of the relationship is to foster the love and commitment between the relationships.
John Eastman (role: for): Yeah.
John Donvan (role: mod): John, just for clarity, what do you mean-- just if you can be more concrete about the sense of ""similarly situated.""
John Eastman (role: for): And it's that change in the understanding of the purpose of the institution of marriage that requires us to treat this as a new claim rather than just access to the existing institution.
John Eastman (role: for): And you necessarily have to be rejecting the view of marriage in which the groups are quite obviously not similarly situated.
John Eastman (role: for): Look, because the test the Supreme Court has developed for addressing these equal protection questions is whether the groups are similarly situated, you have to be adopting a view of marriage in which the groups are similarly situated to make that claim.
John Eastman (role: for): Yeah, I do.
John Donvan (role: mod): John Eastman, you want to respond?
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): They sought the right to marry.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): They did not seek the specific right to inmate marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): However, when those plaintiffs sought the right to marry, they did not seek the specific right to interracial marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): So, for example, if we look at Loving v. Virginia, or Turner v. Safley, which my friend and colleague Evan Wolfson referred to, those are cases pertaining to interracial marriage and inmate marriage.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): We are a new group asking for access to an existing right.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): I would say that we're not asking for a new right.
Kenji Yoshino (role: against): Yeah.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to ask you to respond to that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponents are saying that by citing the Equal Protection Clause, you can only do so by fundamentally redefining marriage, and in doing so, actually creating a new right.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go to the team arguing against the motion which in this case means that you actually are arguing that the Constitution supports and requires states to license same- sex marriage.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they go back into history to the time in 1868 when the Equal Protection Clause was written into the 14th amendment, pointing out that they believe that it was left unspecified-- left to future generations to decide what equality was going to mean.
John Donvan (role: mod): They site the fact that there are 60 percent support in polls for single sex marriage and argue that given historical disadvantage of gay people, that only willful blindness would allow the perception that same-sex marriage is not constitutionally protected.
John Donvan (role: mod): The freedom to marry is the freedom to marry.
John Donvan (role: mod): They argue that, look, it's very simple.
John Donvan (role: mod): Arguing against them, we have heard from Evan Wolfson and Kenji Yoshino.
John Donvan (role: mod): They also make the point that, repeatedly, when the court has addressed the issue of marriages of fundamental right, it has made it clear that the court, in the court's opinion, that is marriage between one man and one woman.
John Donvan (role: mod): It is not explicit at all, but they argue that the traditional vision of marriage, which they use the term ""conjugal,"" that that vision has historical roots that need to be respected, that in fact the Equal Protection Clause is only to be summoned in situations, very rare instances when majority rule needs to be asserted, but that this is not one of those cases.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have argued that the Constitution does not actually settle this issue.
John Donvan (role: mod): Arguing in support of this motion, we've heard from John Eastman and Sherif Girgis.
John Donvan (role: mod): Our motion is ""The Equal Protection Clause does not require states to license same-sex marriages.""
John Donvan (role: mod): And round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you, our live audience here in Philadelphia.
John Donvan (role: mod): ""Now we move on to round two.

Niall Ferguson (role: for): You only have to look north of the border.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): It’s not difficult to see that “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) there was a grotesque failure on the part of regulators and politicians here.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): And that is our central point.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): So if you simply look at what’s happened there it becomes obvious that something was egregiously wrong with the regulatory environment in the United States.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): That country is called Canada.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): You don’t have to travel terribly far, actually, to get to a country where banks are and have been adequately regulated.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): But they’re not all experiencing a financial crisis.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): Now, most countries in the world are experiencing an economic crisis, largely as a consequence of what is happening here.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): Well, I think one way of answering that question is to ask whether every country in the world is having a financial crisis comparable to the one that’s being experienced in the United States.
John Donvan (role: mod): My question really is, if Washington had performed its job well, would we have an economic crisis?

John Donvan (role: mod): So on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): So we’re now going to move on to round two and in round two the debaters talk to each other directly and they also take questions from us.

Niall Ferguson (role: for): This, I think, is the point that John Steele Gordon, Nouriel Roubini and I want to stress.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): The trouble is that the deregulation, much of which was justifiable, was taken to excess.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): The heavy regulations that were imposed during and after the Great Depression didn’t actually prove to be that benign.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): So, no, I’m not in favor of more regulation.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): Certainly the recession of the early 1970s was as serious as anything we’ve experienced so far, though I don’t rule out that this is going to get worse.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): I’m old enough to remember stagflation and the secondary banking crisis in the U.K. and the problems of that period were in many ways as serious.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): If you think back to the highly regulated financial markets of the 1970s, it’s not as if that “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) was a period without financial crisis.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): Can I conclude my point?
Nell Minow (role: against): Well, in what way is it better?
Niall Ferguson (role: for): I’ve never said I’m in favor of more regulation, simply better regulation.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): On the contrary.
Nell Minow (role: against): Is that what you’re arguing for?
Nell Minow (role: against): But I’m not sure that I think that more regulation is the answer.
Nell Minow (role: against): As I said, they all relied too heavily on the same set of numbers.

John Donvan (role: mod): Nouriel Roubini, let’s let Nouriel Roubini come in and respond.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): You know, after the Great Depression we imposed a system of strong regulations of the financial system, capital controls and for a few decades there were not that many financial crises and banking crises.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): If you look around, for the last twenty years, you have had financial crises and banking crises and so on in a number of countries.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): Now, some deregulation was good.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): Even probably we swang the balance too much in the direction of too much regulation after the Great Depression and that led to not enough financial innovation.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): And therefore, there is a strong correlation between the quality of the regulatory and supervisory regime and whether financial crisis occurs.

Nell Minow<against>: Editor and Co-Founder of The Corporate Library","Nell Minow (role: against): Well, in what way is it better?
Niall Ferguson (role: for): Can I conclude my point?
Niall Ferguson (role: for): If you think back to the highly regulated financial markets of the 1970s, it’s not as if that “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) was a period without financial crisis.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): I’m old enough to remember stagflation and the secondary banking crisis in the U.K. and the problems of that period were in many ways as serious.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): Certainly the recession of the early 1970s was as serious as anything we’ve experienced so far, though I don’t rule out that this is going to get worse.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): So, no, I’m not in favor of more regulation.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): The heavy regulations that were imposed during and after the Great Depression didn’t actually prove to be that benign.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): The trouble is that the deregulation, much of which was justifiable, was taken to excess.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): This, I think, is the point that John Steele Gordon, Nouriel Roubini and I want to stress.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): And it’s not difficult, if one compares different regulatory frameworks around the world, to see why the U.S. was so bad.
Nell Minow (role: against): But don’t you think the fact, the point that I made about six hundred million dollars being poured into Washington, they don’t have that system in Canada, either, for lobbying and for political campaign fundraising.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): But you understate the case.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) I think there is a strong correlation that goes to history between degree of proper regulation and financial crisis.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): It’s not just the U.S.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): And what has been changing over the last twenty years, starting with Ronald Reagan and then Margaret Thatcher, the ideology became of deregulation at any cost, first in advanced economies and then in emerging markets.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): Nobody is in favor of excess.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): But deregulation without a proper institution and so on has been known to lead to financial crises, like in East Asia, like in Mexico, like in Argentina and so on.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): There’s a trade off between the two, but that’s what’s really the fact that now in spite of the great moderation, low inflation and growth, these financial crises are “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) occurring now more frequently.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): Now occur every other year – more frequently, more virulent and more costly in every way.
Alex Berenson (role: against): Certainly there has been a huge amount of deregulation in the last twenty years.
Alex Berenson (role: against): Firms, you know, Wall Street was essentially a set of partnerships, largely, until the Seventies and by the Nineties, I think, Goldman was the last big firm to give up the partnership model.
Alex Berenson (role: against): It’s your shareholders’ capital at risk.
Alex Berenson (role: against): I don’t think it’s an accident that there are some small partnerships out there that have essentially thri-- Well, thrive may be too strong a word.
Alex Berenson (role: against): The other very, very important change, really the most important change, is the egregious increase in compensation.
Alex Berenson (role: against): Let’s say you’re making some multiple of an average American’s salary, where if you do that for ten years, you’re, you know, you’re very well off.
Alex Berenson (role: against): It really skews your incentives.
John Steele Gordon (role: for): I just want to point out that Nell has said that Wall Street spent six hundred million dollars lobbying Washington for regulations that Wall Street liked.
John Steele Gordon (role: for): On the other hand, Washington took the money and produced the regulation.
Nell Minow (role: against): You know what?
Nell Minow (role: against): And, people have got to get re-elected.

John Donvan (role: mod): And we heard your teammates say that Washington did not do its job well.
John Donvan (role: mod): My question really is, if Washington had performed its job well, would we have an economic crisis?
Niall Ferguson (role: for): Well, I think one way of answering that question is to ask whether every country in the world is having a financial crisis comparable to the one that’s being experienced in the United States.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): Now, most countries in the world are experiencing an economic crisis, largely as a consequence of what is happening here.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): But they’re not all experiencing a financial crisis.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): You don’t have to travel terribly far, actually, to get to a country where banks are and have been adequately regulated.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): That country is called Canada.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): So if you simply look at what’s happened there it becomes obvious that something was egregiously wrong with the regulatory environment in the United States.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): And that is our central point.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): It’s not difficult to see that “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) there was a grotesque failure on the part of regulators and politicians here.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): You only have to look north of the border.
John Donvan (role: mod): Nell Minow, you’re on the opposite side of the, of the argument but I see you nodding.
Nell Minow (role: against): Well...
Niall Ferguson (role: for): That’s always a good sign.
Nell Minow (role: against): You know, the fact is that the banks are supposed to be able to respond to whatever is provided for them in some kind of a rational way.
Nell Minow (role: against): And they didn’t do.
Nell Minow (role: against): As I said, they all relied too heavily on the same set of numbers.
Nell Minow (role: against): But I’m not sure that I think that more regulation is the answer.
Nell Minow (role: against): Is that what you’re arguing for?
Niall Ferguson (role: for): On the contrary.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): I’ve never said I’m in favor of more regulation, simply better regulation.

John Donvan (role: mod): We’ll poll you again at the end of the evening “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) and the team that moves most votes, the team that changes most minds will be declared our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): So we’re now going to move on to round two and in round two the debaters talk to each other directly and they also take questions from us.
John Donvan (role: mod): So on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I just want to ask Niall Ferguson, since your side is arguing that Wall Street should be blamed for the economic crisis and we heard your ca...I’m sorry, Washington should be blamed for the economic crisis.
John Donvan (role: mod): And we heard your teammates say that Washington did not do its job well.
John Donvan (role: mod): My question really is, if Washington had performed its job well, would we have an economic crisis?
Niall Ferguson (role: for): Well, I think one way of answering that question is to ask whether every country in the world is having a financial crisis comparable to the one that’s being experienced in the United States.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): Now, most countries in the world are experiencing an economic crisis, largely as a consequence of what is happening here.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): But they’re not all experiencing a financial crisis.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): You don’t have to travel terribly far, actually, to get to a country where banks are and have been adequately regulated.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): That country is called Canada.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): So if you simply look at what’s happened there it becomes obvious that something was egregiously wrong with the regulatory environment in the United States.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): And that is our central point.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): It’s not difficult to see that “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) there was a grotesque failure on the part of regulators and politicians here.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): You only have to look north of the border.
John Donvan (role: mod): Nell Minow, you’re on the opposite side of the, of the argument but I see you nodding.
Nell Minow (role: against): Well...
Niall Ferguson (role: for): That’s always a good sign.
Nell Minow (role: against): You know, the fact is that the banks are supposed to be able to respond to whatever is provided for them in some kind of a rational way.
Nell Minow (role: against): And they didn’t do.
Nell Minow (role: against): As I said, they all relied too heavily on the same set of numbers.
Nell Minow (role: against): But I’m not sure that I think that more regulation is the answer.
Nell Minow (role: against): Is that what you’re arguing for?
Niall Ferguson (role: for): On the contrary.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): I’ve never said I’m in favor of more regulation, simply better regulation.
Nell Minow (role: against): Well, in what way is it better?
Niall Ferguson (role: for): Can I conclude my point?
Niall Ferguson (role: for): If you think back to the highly regulated financial markets of the 1970s, it’s not as if that “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) was a period without financial crisis.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): I’m old enough to remember stagflation and the secondary banking crisis in the U.K. and the problems of that period were in many ways as serious.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): Certainly the recession of the early 1970s was as serious as anything we’ve experienced so far, though I don’t rule out that this is going to get worse.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): So, no, I’m not in favor of more regulation.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): The heavy regulations that were imposed during and after the Great Depression didn’t actually prove to be that benign.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): The trouble is that the deregulation, much of which was justifiable, was taken to excess.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): This, I think, is the point that John Steele Gordon, Nouriel Roubini and I want to stress.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): And it’s not difficult, if one compares different regulatory frameworks around the world, to see why the U.S. was so bad.
Nell Minow (role: against): But don’t you think the fact, the point that I made about six hundred million dollars being poured into Washington, they don’t have that system in Canada, either, for lobbying and for political campaign fundraising.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): But you understate the case.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) I think there is a strong correlation that goes to history between degree of proper regulation and financial crisis.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): It’s not just the U.S.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): And what has been changing over the last twenty years, starting with Ronald Reagan and then Margaret Thatcher, the ideology became of deregulation at any cost, first in advanced economies and then in emerging markets.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): Nobody is in favor of excess.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): But deregulation without a proper institution and so on has been known to lead to financial crises, like in East Asia, like in Mexico, like in Argentina and so on.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): There’s a trade off between the two, but that’s what’s really the fact that now in spite of the great moderation, low inflation and growth, these financial crises are “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) occurring now more frequently.","{'breakdown': None, 'post': {'undecided': 9.0, 'for': 60.0, 'against': 31.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 28.0, 'for': 42.0, 'against': 30.0}}",Nouriel Roubini,for,"Now occur every other year – more frequently, more virulent and more costly in every way."

Niall Ferguson (role: for): So if you simply look at what’s happened there it becomes obvious that something was egregiously wrong with the regulatory environment in the United States.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): That country is called Canada.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): You don’t have to travel terribly far, actually, to get to a country where banks are and have been adequately regulated.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): But they’re not all experiencing a financial crisis.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): Now, most countries in the world are experiencing an economic crisis, largely as a consequence of what is happening here.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): Well, I think one way of answering that question is to ask whether every country in the world is having a financial crisis comparable to the one that’s being experienced in the United States.
John Donvan (role: mod): My question really is, if Washington had performed its job well, would we have an economic crisis?
John Donvan (role: mod): And we heard your teammates say that Washington did not do its job well.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I just want to ask Niall Ferguson, since your side is arguing that Wall Street should be blamed for the economic crisis and we heard your ca...I’m sorry, Washington should be blamed for the economic crisis.
John Donvan (role: mod): So on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): So we’re now going to move on to round two and in round two the debaters talk to each other directly and they also take questions from us.
John Donvan (role: mod): We’ll poll you again at the end of the evening “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) and the team that moves most votes, the team that changes most minds will be declared our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): Restating the motion: Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis, forty-two percent of you vote for this motion, thirty percent vote against and twenty-eight percent remain undecided.
John Donvan (role: mod): And we have the first results from that first vote.
John Donvan (role: mod): We had you vote when you came in, vote on whether you side with the motion, against the motion or are undecided.
John Donvan (role: mod): You know, and that concludes round one, opening remarks of this debate.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Nell.
John Donvan (role: mod): Nouriel Roubini, let’s let Nouriel Roubini come in and respond.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): You know, after the Great Depression we imposed a system of strong regulations of the financial system, capital controls and for a few decades there were not that many financial crises and banking crises.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): If you look around, for the last twenty years, you have had financial crises and banking crises and so on in a number of countries.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): Now, some deregulation was good.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): Even probably we swang the balance too much in the direction of too much regulation after the Great Depression and that led to not enough financial innovation.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): And therefore, there is a strong correlation between the quality of the regulatory and supervisory regime and whether financial crisis occurs.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): These should occur once every thousand years.
John Donvan (role: mod): Alex Berenson, from the other side.
Alex Berenson (role: against): There’s also been major changes in the structure of Wall Street.
Alex Berenson (role: against): So, again, it’s not your capital at risk anymore.
Alex Berenson (role: against): You don’t own your firm anymore, you own a portion of it.
Alex Berenson (role: against): But they have survived this crisis.
Alex Berenson (role: against): It’s one thing if you’re making five hundred thousand dollars a year.
Alex Berenson (role: against): It’s another thing if one good year makes your life and “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) makes your children’s lives.
John Donvan (role: mod): John Steele Gordon.
John Steele Gordon (role: for): I’m sure that’s perfectly true.
John Donvan (role: mod): Nell?
Nell Minow (role: against): Washington has its own market system.

Nell Minow (role: against): And they didn’t do.
Nell Minow (role: against): As I said, they all relied too heavily on the same set of numbers.
Nell Minow (role: against): But I’m not sure that I think that more regulation is the answer.
Nell Minow (role: against): Is that what you’re arguing for?
Niall Ferguson (role: for): On the contrary.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): I’ve never said I’m in favor of more regulation, simply better regulation.
Nell Minow (role: against): Well, in what way is it better?
Niall Ferguson (role: for): Can I conclude my point?
Niall Ferguson (role: for): If you think back to the highly regulated financial markets of the 1970s, it’s not as if that “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) was a period without financial crisis.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): I’m old enough to remember stagflation and the secondary banking crisis in the U.K. and the problems of that period were in many ways as serious.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): Certainly the recession of the early 1970s was as serious as anything we’ve experienced so far, though I don’t rule out that this is going to get worse.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): So, no, I’m not in favor of more regulation.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): The heavy regulations that were imposed during and after the Great Depression didn’t actually prove to be that benign.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): The trouble is that the deregulation, much of which was justifiable, was taken to excess.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): This, I think, is the point that John Steele Gordon, Nouriel Roubini and I want to stress.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): And it’s not difficult, if one compares different regulatory frameworks around the world, to see why the U.S. was so bad.
Nell Minow (role: against): But don’t you think the fact, the point that I made about six hundred million dollars being poured into Washington, they don’t have that system in Canada, either, for lobbying and for political campaign fundraising.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): But you understate the case.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) I think there is a strong correlation that goes to history between degree of proper regulation and financial crisis.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): It’s not just the U.S.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): And what has been changing over the last twenty years, starting with Ronald Reagan and then Margaret Thatcher, the ideology became of deregulation at any cost, first in advanced economies and then in emerging markets.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): Nobody is in favor of excess.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): But deregulation without a proper institution and so on has been known to lead to financial crises, like in East Asia, like in Mexico, like in Argentina and so on.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): There’s a trade off between the two, but that’s what’s really the fact that now in spite of the great moderation, low inflation and growth, these financial crises are “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) occurring now more frequently.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): Now occur every other year – more frequently, more virulent and more costly in every way.

John Steele Gordon (role: for): I just want to point out that Nell has said that Wall Street spent six hundred million dollars lobbying Washington for regulations that Wall Street liked.

Nell Minow (role: against): Well, in what way is it better?

Niall Ferguson (role: for): If you think back to the highly regulated financial markets of the 1970s, it’s not as if that “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) was a period without financial crisis.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): I’m old enough to remember stagflation and the secondary banking crisis in the U.K. and the problems of that period were in many ways as serious.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): Certainly the recession of the early 1970s was as serious as anything we’ve experienced so far, though I don’t rule out that this is going to get worse.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): So, no, I’m not in favor of more regulation.
Niall Ferguson (role: for): The heavy regulations that were imposed during and after the Great Depression didn’t actually prove to be that benign.

Nouriel Roubini (role: for): But you understate the case.
Nouriel Roubini (role: for): “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street” (3/17/09) I think there is a strong correlation that goes to history between degree of proper regulation and financial crisis.
