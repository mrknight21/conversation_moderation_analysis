Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): And I'm so happy that she had a successful pregnancy.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): But she had choices.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): One of her choices was to adopt someone else's egg and have a baby.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): She-- it wouldn't be her DNA but it would be somebody else's DNA.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): Another choice would be for her to adopt a child, which, you know, is certainly a desirable thing to do in a world where there are children who need adoption.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): What is the urgency of people to have their DNA in their child?
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): In fact, most of the things that our children get do not get from our DNA, they get from all the enhancement that we give them, so there's this obsession that ""My child has to have my DNA.""
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): She did have some other choices.

Lee Silver (role: against): And I have no conflict there.
Lee Silver (role: against): I don't think we should discriminate against those people who, for whatever reason, are unable to reproduce and say, ""Well, they don't have the ability, therefore, they should be adopting or solving other societal problems.""
John Donvan (role: mod): Sheldon, I want to put a question to you, or Robert, whoever wants to take it, that your opponents in their opening statements focused primarily on enhancement that ameliorates negatives.
John Donvan (role: mod): Before we get on to the other side of it about enhancing-- you know, to create pretty people and tall people, do you see the distinction between a genetic intervention to avoid pain and suffering as opposed to making a superman?

John Donvan (role: mod): Nita Farahany, your response.
Nita Farahany (role: against): It's true that this is an argument one could make in nearly any area, but it's different in this one because this isn't just that other countries are doing it.
Nita Farahany (role: against): It's that other countries have studied it, they have found it to be scientifically and ethically valid.
Nita Farahany (role: against): The U.K. has the human fertilization and embryology authority.
Nita Farahany (role: against): Unlike the U.S., things happen there with oversight, public oversight.
Nita Farahany (role: against): This organization held a long inquiry inviting scientific and ethical input.
Nita Farahany (role: against): The Nuffield Council on Bioethics likewise in the U.K. looked into mitochondrial DNA transfer.
Nita Farahany (role: against): What they urged the U.K. to do is to green light this technology and go ahead.
Nita Farahany (role: against): We are not saying all genetic engineering.
Nita Farahany (role: against): This particular type has the green light.
Nita Farahany (role: against): We would be left behind if we decide to prohibit it.
John Donvan (role: mod): Robert Winston, your opponent.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): Well, it's nice to be able to answer Nita firsthand, because, of course, I happen to be a member of the British Parliament, the upper house, and we voted overwhelmingly to abolish the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority because it's useless.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): And actually it's inhibited research.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): It's not a very good way of regulating.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): So I don't think you should hold up the British model.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): What is needed actually-- what I think is needed is a consensus amongst all of us that we act as far as we can ethically and in the best interest of patients, whatever that might mean.

Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): But she had choices.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): One of her choices was to adopt someone else's egg and have a baby.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): She-- it wouldn't be her DNA but it would be somebody else's DNA.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): Another choice would be for her to adopt a child, which, you know, is certainly a desirable thing to do in a world where there are children who need adoption.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): What is the urgency of people to have their DNA in their child?
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): In fact, most of the things that our children get do not get from our DNA, they get from all the enhancement that we give them, so there's this obsession that ""My child has to have my DNA.""
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): She did have some other choices.

Lord Robert Winston (role: for): I--
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): I think it was a very clear distinction, and I think the other side are absolutely right to concentrate on genetic abnormalities because, of course, gene defects are appalling.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): Children in the main die of genetic defects.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): They're deeply unpleasant, and there's no question that if we could avoid these diseases, if we could prevent them or treat them more effectively, we should do so.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): But I think the problem really is that, first of all, there will be enhancement.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): And the difficulty really is that in preventing one genetic disease, you're likely, very likely, to cause another genetic disease.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): The ENCODE data which has just been published show that there are not just 20,000 genes, but literally 3- or 4 million sequences already known in the messenger RNA, for example, which have an effect--
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): No, I'm not-- I'm not conceding the point, but I can--- what I'm saying is it's a seductive point and I can understand why they're concentrating on it, because the rest of the argument is bound to be very weak.
Lee Silver (role: against): There is no rest to the argument.
John Donvan (role: mod): But I also think-- the reason I was looking for clarity, I thought that I heard Robert Winston say that it's just not practical, realistic, to do these interventions to prevent disease because you don't know enough.

Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): I was going to leave that for my final comments because I truly was plagued by the mitochondria problem.

John Donvan (role: mod): Round two is where the debaters address each other and take questions from me and you in the audience.
John Donvan (role: mod): Our motion is ""prohibit genetically engineered babies.""
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing it.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing for the prohibition include Sheldon Krimsky and Robert Winston.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have made an argument, as I hear it, that goes both scientifically and morally.
John Donvan (role: mod): The scientific argument boiled down is that genetics is an enormously complex field.
John Donvan (role: mod): It is not yet well understood, that there is enormous potential for horrendous mistakes to be made.
John Donvan (role: mod): The crux of their moral argument is that the pursuit of a myth of human perfection is immoral and ultimately corrosive.
John Donvan (role: mod): The Nazis fell for it with calamitous results.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're talking about a slippery slope that we're just at the beginning of now.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the prohibition says, No.
John Donvan (role: mod): 1, it would be-- the immoral thing is to ignore the opportunity to use genetics as a tool to correct and avoid enormous situations of pain and suffering, that the United States will be left behind in something that has already begun to happen.
John Donvan (role: mod): And in terms of the complexity, we just heard that in fact there is a way to find a road map through this forest by studying what is known already, what is observed in the population, that it's not-- that there's not a way into this-- into this forest and a way out of it again.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I want to put questions to each of the sides in turn.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to begin with just this broad notion of the U.S. being left behind.
John Donvan (role: mod): Since we're talking about a prohibition, we're talking about, in that sense, something legal or regulatory.
John Donvan (role: mod): The side arguing against prohibition says the net result of that would be to leave the U.S. behind in something that is happening already, that this train has left the station.
John Donvan (role: mod): Sheldon Krimsky, can you respond to that?
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): Well, that's an all-purpose argument that you can apply for many things.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): We have all kind of moral provisions in the United States.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): We don't allow the sale of organs.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): We restrict certain types of uses of viruses in research.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): We prohibit certain experiments with animals that are considered immoral.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): We can always use that argument and say somebody will be left behind, but we have to establish moral principles and safety principles that make sense to our scientific community and our general society.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Sheldon.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I just want to ask the panelists not to hold the mic, because of vibrations are picked up.
John Donvan (role: mod): Nita Farahany, your response.
Nita Farahany (role: against): It's true that this is an argument one could make in nearly any area, but it's different in this one because this isn't just that other countries are doing it.
Nita Farahany (role: against): It's that other countries have studied it, they have found it to be scientifically and ethically valid.
Nita Farahany (role: against): The U.K. has the human fertilization and embryology authority.
Nita Farahany (role: against): Unlike the U.S., things happen there with oversight, public oversight.
Nita Farahany (role: against): This organization held a long inquiry inviting scientific and ethical input.
Nita Farahany (role: against): The Nuffield Council on Bioethics likewise in the U.K. looked into mitochondrial DNA transfer.
Nita Farahany (role: against): What they urged the U.K. to do is to green light this technology and go ahead.
Nita Farahany (role: against): We are not saying all genetic engineering.

Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): Another choice would be for her to adopt a child, which, you know, is certainly a desirable thing to do in a world where there are children who need adoption.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): What is the urgency of people to have their DNA in their child?
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): In fact, most of the things that our children get do not get from our DNA, they get from all the enhancement that we give them, so there's this obsession that ""My child has to have my DNA.""

Lord Robert Winston (role: for): They're deeply unpleasant, and there's no question that if we could avoid these diseases, if we could prevent them or treat them more effectively, we should do so.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): But I think the problem really is that, first of all, there will be enhancement.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): And the difficulty really is that in preventing one genetic disease, you're likely, very likely, to cause another genetic disease.

Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): One of her choices was to adopt someone else's egg and have a baby.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): She-- it wouldn't be her DNA but it would be somebody else's DNA.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): Another choice would be for her to adopt a child, which, you know, is certainly a desirable thing to do in a world where there are children who need adoption.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): What is the urgency of people to have their DNA in their child?
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): In fact, most of the things that our children get do not get from our DNA, they get from all the enhancement that we give them, so there's this obsession that ""My child has to have my DNA.""

John Donvan (role: mod): Before we get on to the other side of it about enhancing-- you know, to create pretty people and tall people, do you see the distinction between a genetic intervention to avoid pain and suffering as opposed to making a superman?

Lord Robert Winston (role: for): A few of them like mitochondrial diseases don't always kill people but they often have major effects on the central nervous system.
John Donvan (role: mod): So do you concede that point to them?
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): And I think that's risky.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): The fact, of course, is that we now know that there are only 20,000 genes in the human genome, but there's a huge amount happening outside the genome which is of vital importance.

John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our motion is, prohibit genetically engineered babies.
John Donvan (role: mod): And now we move on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): Round two is where the debaters address each other and take questions from me and you in the audience.
John Donvan (role: mod): Our motion is ""prohibit genetically engineered babies.""
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing it.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing for the prohibition include Sheldon Krimsky and Robert Winston.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have made an argument, as I hear it, that goes both scientifically and morally.
John Donvan (role: mod): The scientific argument boiled down is that genetics is an enormously complex field.
John Donvan (role: mod): It is not yet well understood, that there is enormous potential for horrendous mistakes to be made.
John Donvan (role: mod): The crux of their moral argument is that the pursuit of a myth of human perfection is immoral and ultimately corrosive.
John Donvan (role: mod): The Nazis fell for it with calamitous results.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're talking about a slippery slope that we're just at the beginning of now.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the prohibition says, No.
John Donvan (role: mod): 1, it would be-- the immoral thing is to ignore the opportunity to use genetics as a tool to correct and avoid enormous situations of pain and suffering, that the United States will be left behind in something that has already begun to happen.
John Donvan (role: mod): And in terms of the complexity, we just heard that in fact there is a way to find a road map through this forest by studying what is known already, what is observed in the population, that it's not-- that there's not a way into this-- into this forest and a way out of it again.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I want to put questions to each of the sides in turn.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to begin with just this broad notion of the U.S. being left behind.
John Donvan (role: mod): Since we're talking about a prohibition, we're talking about, in that sense, something legal or regulatory.
John Donvan (role: mod): The side arguing against prohibition says the net result of that would be to leave the U.S. behind in something that is happening already, that this train has left the station.
John Donvan (role: mod): Sheldon Krimsky, can you respond to that?
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): Well, that's an all-purpose argument that you can apply for many things.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): We have all kind of moral provisions in the United States.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): We don't allow the sale of organs.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): We restrict certain types of uses of viruses in research.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): We prohibit certain experiments with animals that are considered immoral.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): We can always use that argument and say somebody will be left behind, but we have to establish moral principles and safety principles that make sense to our scientific community and our general society.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Sheldon.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I just want to ask the panelists not to hold the mic, because of vibrations are picked up.
John Donvan (role: mod): Nita Farahany, your response.
Nita Farahany (role: against): It's true that this is an argument one could make in nearly any area, but it's different in this one because this isn't just that other countries are doing it.
Nita Farahany (role: against): It's that other countries have studied it, they have found it to be scientifically and ethically valid.
Nita Farahany (role: against): The U.K. has the human fertilization and embryology authority.
Nita Farahany (role: against): Unlike the U.S., things happen there with oversight, public oversight.
Nita Farahany (role: against): This organization held a long inquiry inviting scientific and ethical input.
Nita Farahany (role: against): The Nuffield Council on Bioethics likewise in the U.K. looked into mitochondrial DNA transfer.
Nita Farahany (role: against): What they urged the U.K. to do is to green light this technology and go ahead.
Nita Farahany (role: against): We are not saying all genetic engineering.
Nita Farahany (role: against): This particular type has the green light.
Nita Farahany (role: against): We would be left behind if we decide to prohibit it.
John Donvan (role: mod): Robert Winston, your opponent.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): Well, it's nice to be able to answer Nita firsthand, because, of course, I happen to be a member of the British Parliament, the upper house, and we voted overwhelmingly to abolish the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority because it's useless.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): And actually it's inhibited research.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): It's not a very good way of regulating.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): So I don't think you should hold up the British model.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): What is needed actually-- what I think is needed is a consensus amongst all of us that we act as far as we can ethically and in the best interest of patients, whatever that might mean.
John Donvan (role: mod): Nita, do you want to respond?
Nita Farahany (role: against): Sure, yeah, I also agree, we should act ethically.
Nita Farahany (role: against): And the most ethical thing to do in circumstances where the only way to prevent a particular type of disease where we readily have a technology available that people will avail themselves of either in this country or another one is to give the green light to proceed.
Nita Farahany (role: against): The ethical way to proceed is to study a technology, to have an open public debate about a technology, to have scientific valid-- scientifically valid studies that are allowed to proceed.

Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): I was going to leave that for my final comments because I truly was plagued by the mitochondria problem.

Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): And these interactions between the nucleus DNA and the cytoplasm DNA are totally unknown.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): There are other ways to do it.

Lord Robert Winston (role: for): And the difficulty really is that in preventing one genetic disease, you're likely, very likely, to cause another genetic disease.

Lee Silver (role: against): There is no rest to the argument.

John Donvan (role: mod): 1, it would be-- the immoral thing is to ignore the opportunity to use genetics as a tool to correct and avoid enormous situations of pain and suffering, that the United States will be left behind in something that has already begun to happen.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the prohibition says, No.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're talking about a slippery slope that we're just at the beginning of now.
John Donvan (role: mod): The Nazis fell for it with calamitous results.
John Donvan (role: mod): The crux of their moral argument is that the pursuit of a myth of human perfection is immoral and ultimately corrosive.
John Donvan (role: mod): It is not yet well understood, that there is enormous potential for horrendous mistakes to be made.
John Donvan (role: mod): The scientific argument boiled down is that genetics is an enormously complex field.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have made an argument, as I hear it, that goes both scientifically and morally.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing for the prohibition include Sheldon Krimsky and Robert Winston.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing it.
John Donvan (role: mod): Our motion is ""prohibit genetically engineered babies.""
John Donvan (role: mod): Round two is where the debaters address each other and take questions from me and you in the audience.
John Donvan (role: mod): And now we move on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our motion is, prohibit genetically engineered babies.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Lee Silver.
Lee Silver (role: against): Well, Professor Krimsky and I both have children here in the audience, so we--
Lee Silver (role: against): We live in the same building--
Lee Silver (role: against): We have coffee at Jack's, the best coffee in the city.
Lee Silver (role: against): And we both have children in the audience, so we've used our ability to reproduce to have our children who I'm sure that you love your children as much as I love mine.
Lee Silver (role: against): I don't think that's fair because we don't ask ourselves to adopt, although a very, very few people do, so I question the alternative here.
John Donvan (role: mod): They mostly talked about helping produce children who wouldn't have dreaded illnesses, conditions, and diseases.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 4.5, 'undecided_for': 19.0, 'for_against': 4.5, 'for_for': 18.0, 'undecided_against': 23.0, 'for_undecided': 4.0, 'undecided_undecided': 4.0, 'against_undecided': 3.0, 'against_against': 20.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 10.0, 'for': 41.0, 'against': 49.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 46.0, 'for': 24.0, 'against': 30.0}}",Lord Robert Winston,for,I--

Lord Robert Winston (role: for): And I think that's risky.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): The fact, of course, is that we now know that there are only 20,000 genes in the human genome, but there's a huge amount happening outside the genome which is of vital importance.
John Donvan (role: mod): So you are not conceding the point that intervention--
John Donvan (role: mod): Nita Farahany.
Lee Silver (role: against): Our argument is that people all differ, we have genes that are different from each other in promoting or preventing disease and we think that, on that ground, parents should have the right to be able to promote health.
John Donvan (role: mod): And you specifically said this sort of intervention can actually promote other genetic outcomes.
Nita Farahany (role: against): Well, I mean, I have news for you, which is every single time we choose to reproduce there's uncertainty.
Nita Farahany (role: against): And we certainly aren't going to say that we're going to ban natural reproduction, which is no more sex and no more kids.
Nita Farahany (role: against): Instead, what we're going to do is we're going to ensure the scientific safety and efficacy of technologies before we allow them to proceed, and with mitochondrial transfer, which is a major form of genetic engineering, we have already had major scientific studies and an emerging scientific consensus that shows it's safe, it works, it eliminates massive childhood suffering.

Lord Robert Winston (role: for): A few of them like mitochondrial diseases don't always kill people but they often have major effects on the central nervous system.
John Donvan (role: mod): So do you concede that point to them?
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): And I think that's risky.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): The fact, of course, is that we now know that there are only 20,000 genes in the human genome, but there's a huge amount happening outside the genome which is of vital importance.
John Donvan (role: mod): So you are not conceding the point that intervention--
John Donvan (role: mod): Nita Farahany.
Lee Silver (role: against): Our argument is that people all differ, we have genes that are different from each other in promoting or preventing disease and we think that, on that ground, parents should have the right to be able to promote health.
John Donvan (role: mod): And you specifically said this sort of intervention can actually promote other genetic outcomes.
Nita Farahany (role: against): Well, I mean, I have news for you, which is every single time we choose to reproduce there's uncertainty.
Nita Farahany (role: against): And we certainly aren't going to say that we're going to ban natural reproduction, which is no more sex and no more kids.
Nita Farahany (role: against): Instead, what we're going to do is we're going to ensure the scientific safety and efficacy of technologies before we allow them to proceed, and with mitochondrial transfer, which is a major form of genetic engineering, we have already had major scientific studies and an emerging scientific consensus that shows it's safe, it works, it eliminates massive childhood suffering.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 4.5, 'undecided_for': 19.0, 'for_against': 4.5, 'for_for': 18.0, 'undecided_against': 23.0, 'for_undecided': 4.0, 'undecided_undecided': 4.0, 'against_undecided': 3.0, 'against_against': 20.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 10.0, 'for': 41.0, 'against': 49.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 46.0, 'for': 24.0, 'against': 30.0}}",Lord Robert Winston,for,"Hey, Nita."

Lord Robert Winston (role: for): Of course, we're not.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): And the areas of disagreement are perhaps quite narrow, but they are very, very important.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): And it's dangerous to individuals where the unpredictability
John Donvan (role: mod): You're-- the moral concern that you raised, Sheldon Krimsky, was not simply the problem of the unpredictability of the science.
John Donvan (role: mod): Can you--
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): I was going to leave that for my final comments because I truly was plagued by the mitochondria problem.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): So there has to be a response to the mitochondrial problem or other problems where people have two copies of a diseased gene and cannot use pre-implantation embryo or diagnosis.
Nita Farahany (role: against): I think what's important to realize is that with every slippery slope argument, the question is, is a ban-- a ban outright better, or is there some middle ground?
Nita Farahany (role: against): We've offered one.
Nita Farahany (role: against): It's the essential energy source.
Nita Farahany (role: against): What if we decided that that one step is something we believe is safe and efficacious?

Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): The woman's egg has abnormalities in the cytoplasm.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): But her DNA is perfectly normal.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): They either take her DNA out of her egg and put it into another egg where the DNA has been removed so she'd operating with her DNA in somebody else's mitochondria.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): And these interactions between the nucleus DNA and the cytoplasm DNA are totally unknown.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): There are other ways to do it.
Sheldon Krimsky (role: for): You take the cytoplasm from a healthy egg, and you pump it into the abnormal cytoplasm of the abnormal cells so you're pumping in somebody else's DNA into the woman's egg.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): And your opponent has basically just said the whole premise of what you're talking about is actually its own kind of crap shoot.
Nita Farahany (role: against): There's a technology for mitochondrial transfer that's going to clinical trials from a company in Boston this year.

John Donvan (role: mod): Response from the other side, or shall we go to questions from the audience?
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): I suspect that we might find some surprises as we have with every one of these other trials.
Lord Robert Winston (role: for): It's rather like pre-implantation genetic diagnosis.

John Donvan (role: mod): Sheldon Krimsky, can you respond to that?
John Donvan (role: mod): The side arguing against prohibition says the net result of that would be to leave the U.S. behind in something that is happening already, that this train has left the station.
John Donvan (role: mod): Since we're talking about a prohibition, we're talking about, in that sense, something legal or regulatory.

John Donvan (role: mod): So I want to put questions to each of the sides in turn.

John Donvan (role: mod): 1, it would be-- the immoral thing is to ignore the opportunity to use genetics as a tool to correct and avoid enormous situations of pain and suffering, that the United States will be left behind in something that has already begun to happen.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the prohibition says, No.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're talking about a slippery slope that we're just at the beginning of now.
John Donvan (role: mod): The Nazis fell for it with calamitous results.
John Donvan (role: mod): The crux of their moral argument is that the pursuit of a myth of human perfection is immoral and ultimately corrosive.
John Donvan (role: mod): It is not yet well understood, that there is enormous potential for horrendous mistakes to be made.
John Donvan (role: mod): The scientific argument boiled down is that genetics is an enormously complex field.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have made an argument, as I hear it, that goes both scientifically and morally.

Joel Salatin<against>: Farmer & Author","Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): Well, I'm not so sure because I’m guessing that you get little chicks that have been genetically bred to get obese, and they live about eight weeks, and then you slaughter them.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): I'm guessing they're in a tiny little pen, and they grow up to be obese, and then-- and you are-- these are among the animals that add up to about a million animals per hour, bred and killed, bred and killed, bred and killed.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): I've been doing--
John Donvan (role: mod): Just one--
Joel Salatin (role: against): One of the things that Chris and I are committed to is holding you guys to say, “No exceptions,” because that's the topic.
Joel Salatin (role: against): I would even advocate eating less meat.
Gene Baur (role: for): Yeah, agreed.
Joel Salatin (role: against): And that would actually rectify a lot of the issues that I'm sure all four of us agree on.
Joel Salatin (role: against): But the topic-- the topic is that it is morally reprehensible, and you cannot be compassionate if you're eating meat.
Joel Salatin (role: against): And it's one.
Joel Salatin (role: against): It's one.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go to the audience for questions.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): Sure.
John Donvan (role: mod): Just remember to raise your hand.
John Donvan (role: mod): If you're upstairs, you need to come downstairs and really make it tight and a focused question.
Gene Baur (role: for): You know, the motion is, do we eat anything with a face?
Gene Baur (role: for): So it's great that we all agree that we should eat less animals, and factory farming is bad, but again, it comes down to each individual animal who is killed and eaten.
Gene Baur (role: for): You know, animals die, plants die, they go back into the soil.
Gene Baur (role: for): Killing is an entirely different thing.
Gene Baur (role: for): Well, I mean, I don't know the science about that.
Gene Baur (role: for): But even if that were the case, even if that were the case, eating plants directly, you're causing much less death, because--","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 12.0, 'undecided_for': 15.0, 'for_against': 2.0, 'for_for': 19.0, 'undecided_against': 5.0, 'for_undecided': 3.0, 'undecided_undecided': 5.0, 'against_undecided': 4.0, 'against_against': 36.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 12.0, 'for': 45.0, 'against': 43.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 25.0, 'for': 24.0, 'against': 51.0}}",John Donvan,mod,Chris Masterjohn.

Chris Masterjohn (role: against): Or all of it?
John Donvan (role: mod): Bottom line, you made an argument that you can get sick being a vegan.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): Oh, sure.
John Donvan (role: mod): He's making an argument that there's a whole load of science and statistics that just say you're wrong.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): Right.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): Well, Dr. Barnard is entirely correct, first of all, that all of the studies that I cited about vegetarianism and mental disorders are observational studies, and they cannot show whether vegetarianism causes mental disorders, mental disorders cause vegetarianism, or there's some other type of-- or there's some other type of relationship.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): This is-- I mean, it's serious.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): Any of those are possibilities, and they're not mutually exclusive.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): What we do know is that there is a wealth of information about biochemistry and the effects of the specific nutrient deficiencies that can be most common in vegetarian diets that are all related to mental health.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): And so biologically, it's very plausible.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): But I would like to also make the point that Dr. Barnard cannot have his low- fat, low-glycemic, vegan, chocolate cake and eat it to, because the studies that Dr. Barnard cited at the beginning about the relationship between eating meat and cancer and coronary heart disease are also observational studies, and they also tell us absolutely nothing about cause-and-effect relationships.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): And--
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): Well, let me take issue with you there, if you don't mind.
John Donvan (role: mod): Neal Barnard.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): These are-- these are freaks of breeding over time.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): And if I took one of them who maybe never had even any chemical given to that chicken, but if I kill them and cooked them, these same heterocyclic amines, these clear- cut carcinogens, would form on your chickens just like any other.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): And that's why every epidemiologist agrees that vegetarians have less cancer.
Joel Salatin (role: against): Well-- Anything, if you're trying to create cancer out of something-- an excess of anything can - - you can drink too much water and get sick.
Joel Salatin (role: against): In Argentina, the average person eats half a pound a day of red meat, and their cancer rate is half of the U.S. Why?
Joel Salatin (role: against): And so there is a huge difference in the nutritional profile.

John Donvan (role: mod): And they’re saying there is nothing as nutritious as meat, that it delivers nutrients in far greater density than any other form of food, and they also make the interesting argument that even to be discussing a world of veganism is really a privilege of modernity – that in fact in parts of the world that are not as privileged as the United States, an animal is an investment, an animal represents wealth, and an animal represents food that can be kept alive and fresh until the time that it has to be eaten, and that's the way it always was until very recently.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Chris Masterjohn and Joel Salatin, they’re saying it’s basically-- it’s about the nutrition, folks.
John Donvan (role: mod): They basically argue, bottom line, that we can live well without causing harm to animals, and killing them for food is indeed causing them harm.
John Donvan (role: mod): We heard them make the argument that meat raises the risk of getting sick; that it is simply wrong to kill animals for food, to deny their feelings, and to-- they argue for a respect for animals as a fellow life form.

Joel Salatin<against>: Farmer & Author","John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our motion is, ""Don’t Eat Anything with a Face.""
John Donvan (role: mod): And now we move on to round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate.
John Donvan (role: mod): I’m John Donvan.
John Donvan (role: mod): This is our motion: ""Don’t Eat Anything with a Face.""
John Donvan (role: mod): We have heard from each of our teams in opening statements.
John Donvan (role: mod): We heard from Neal Barnard and Gene Bauer, who are arguing in support of the motion, ""Don’t Eat Anything with a Face.""
John Donvan (role: mod): We heard them make the argument that meat raises the risk of getting sick; that it is simply wrong to kill animals for food, to deny their feelings, and to-- they argue for a respect for animals as a fellow life form.
John Donvan (role: mod): They basically argue, bottom line, that we can live well without causing harm to animals, and killing them for food is indeed causing them harm.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Chris Masterjohn and Joel Salatin, they’re saying it’s basically-- it’s about the nutrition, folks.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they’re saying there is nothing as nutritious as meat, that it delivers nutrients in far greater density than any other form of food, and they also make the interesting argument that even to be discussing a world of veganism is really a privilege of modernity – that in fact in parts of the world that are not as privileged as the United States, an animal is an investment, an animal represents wealth, and an animal represents food that can be kept alive and fresh until the time that it has to be eaten, and that's the way it always was until very recently.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now, we've seen several strains of argument here: practical, health, and ethical.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I'd like to explore all of them.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to stipulate that it's clear that these debaters do agree about one thing.
John Donvan (role: mod): No one on this stage is in favor or arguing to justify factory farming.
John Donvan (role: mod): What they are disagreeing about is whether it is right to kill an animal for food or not.
John Donvan (role: mod): So we want to be focusing on that aspect of this.
John Donvan (role: mod): And on that, there is a strong disagreement among them.
John Donvan (role: mod): What I want to do is take to the side that's arguing for the motion, ""Don’t Eat Anything with a Face,"" who opened with the health argument, that food-- that meat-- makes you sick, that this is well-documented.
John Donvan (role: mod): And we heard personal testimonial of Neal Barnard as a young medical student, seeing that for himself, firsthand, with patients that he was treating, and bring to you, Neal, your opponent Chris Masterjohn's testimony to the opposite.
John Donvan (role: mod): He went on a vegan diet, got really, really sick from it.
John Donvan (role: mod): His teeth started falling apart.
John Donvan (role: mod): He felt terrible, and he went back to meat because his argument is that's where the nutrients are.
John Donvan (role: mod): Neal Barnard.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): Well, I don't want to speak for Chris.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): But having read the documents that he circulated in advance, he had the psychiatric issues before he went vegetarian, while he was vegetarian, and after.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): And if I read them correctly, he said that eating cholesterol was not sufficient, that he also needed religion in order to fight his way back.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): And I say this not to mock it, but to say that these problems were pre-existing before the diet change.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): And the studies that he cited were observational studies.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): We have put this to the test.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): We worked with the insurance company Geico in ten different cities.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): And we introduced plant-based diets for about 300 people, and we measured levels of depression, levels of anxiety.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): They got better.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): And we have now about three randomized trials along these lines.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): People get better.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): And as people who have done this, they find they feel more energetic, which is why a lot of athletes are doing it.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): Dental health acts exactly the same.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): In fact, even the study that he cited, when you looked over the longest period of time, the vegetarians kept their teeth more while the meat-eaters tended to lose them.
Dr. Neal Barnard (role: for): This is not a reason to have a--
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's let Chris respond.
John Donvan (role: mod): And, Chris, we're not-- we're not going to make this a debate about your personal history, okay?
John Donvan (role: mod): And I don't at all think that that's the spirit in which Neal responded, so he was-- he's making the point on the science, and I'd like you to respond on the science as well.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): Sure.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): So I think – the science about whether those studies indicate a causal relationship between vegetarianism and mental disorders?
John Donvan (role: mod): No.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): Or all of it?
John Donvan (role: mod): Bottom line, you made an argument that you can get sick being a vegan.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): Oh, sure.
John Donvan (role: mod): He's making an argument that there's a whole load of science and statistics that just say you're wrong.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): Right.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): Well, Dr. Barnard is entirely correct, first of all, that all of the studies that I cited about vegetarianism and mental disorders are observational studies, and they cannot show whether vegetarianism causes mental disorders, mental disorders cause vegetarianism, or there's some other type of-- or there's some other type of relationship.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): This is-- I mean, it's serious.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): Any of those are possibilities, and they're not mutually exclusive.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): What we do know is that there is a wealth of information about biochemistry and the effects of the specific nutrient deficiencies that can be most common in vegetarian diets that are all related to mental health.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): And so biologically, it's very plausible.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): But I would like to also make the point that Dr. Barnard cannot have his low- fat, low-glycemic, vegan, chocolate cake and eat it to, because the studies that Dr. Barnard cited at the beginning about the relationship between eating meat and cancer and coronary heart disease are also observational studies, and they also tell us absolutely nothing about cause-and-effect relationships.

Gene Baur (role: for): I just wanted--
Gene Baur (role: for): Well, in terms of the science, there's The China Study which the New York Times called the ""Grand Prix of Epidemiology,"" done by T. Colin Campbell, a biochemist at Cornell University.
Gene Baur (role: for): And these were animal foods that were not necessarily produced in factory farms, so just the animal foods were correlated with human health problems, including cancers.
Gene Baur (role: for): It was range-fed meat or grazing animals, and they were still problems.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to move-- I think we have an impasse on this point.

Chris Masterjohn (role: against): Just the one-sentence point.
Chris Masterjohn (role: against): If you read T. Colin Campbell’s book, what he does it make a rather convoluted argument that some things are associated with meat, those things are associated with cancer, and so on, but the actual data doesn’t show a direct correlation like that.
John Donvan (role: mod): And by the way, you as audience members can circle back on some of this when we go to you for questions, but I want to go to Gene Bauer, because where you really stood out in your opening statement was making this-- really, really making this-- strong statement in support of-- I don’t know if the term is oxymoronic, but-- a humanity towards animals.
John Donvan (role: mod): And one of your opponents, Joel Salatin, who raises animals in an organic system, basically made the argument that eating and being eaten is part of life, and that the kind of argument that you’re making about wanting to take supplements and eat only vegetables is a privilege of the 21st century and the United States, and that this is new, and that history, evolution, reality, and most of the rest of the world is: you’ve got to eat meat, and there’s nothing wrong with that.
Gene Baur (role: for): Well, I think over the course of our history, we’ve done what we’ve had to do to survive, and often that has been eating meat, but it’s also sometimes been eating other people.

John Donvan (role: mod): Gene, where do you go on the evolutionary scale, and putting ourselves fairly high up and putting insects fairly low down?

Akhil Reed Amar<against>: Professor of Law, Yale University","John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Akhil Amar.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes opening statements in this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, where our motion is: The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by Waging War Without Congressional Authorization.
John Donvan (role: mod): And now we move on to Round 2.
John Donvan (role: mod): In Round 2, the debaters address one another in-- directly, and they take questions from me and from you, our live audience here at the Miller Theater at Columbia University.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have this motion in front of us: The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by Waging War Without Congressional Authorization.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing for this motion-- that the president has gone too far-- Deborah Pearlstein and Gene Healy have argued that it's right there in writing.
John Donvan (role: mod): It's in the Constitution.
John Donvan (role: mod): Congress declares wars, not the president; that this president, President Obama, has taken more license with war- making than any president in history; that ISIL is an enemy in the conventional sense of conventional war, and therefore, all of the normal rules should apply.
John Donvan (role: mod): But presidential actions, like the bombing of Libya, amount to one man unilaterally taking the nation to war without-- in some cases-- justification of true threats to the nation, and that this is not how a constitutional democracy makes the most important decisions that it ever has to face.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion-- Akhil Amar and Philip Bobbitt-- are arguing that indeed the president has the authorization to take the war to ISIL, that it is the same authorization that was given to George Bush in 2001 after September 11th to defeat enemies, such as Al-Qaeda.
John Donvan (role: mod): It was inherited by Barack Obama; that its elasticity is a matter of practicality, because the enemy changes, and it hasn't changed that much; that in a lot of ways, the guys in ISIL are the same people, with the same tactics, and the same target-- us-- as the target that was chosen by Al-Qaeda on September 11th.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to take that part of the argument to the team that's arguing for the motion and ask them about that notion: that, in fact, what-- the authorization given to George Bush in 2001 still applies, primarily because we're still fighting the same guys in the same extended war.
John Donvan (role: mod): Do you want take that, Deborah Pearlstein?
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): Sure.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): So I find the notion, to use the word, absurd.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): The text of the authorization for the use of force doesn't name them.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): Congress never conceived that ISIL was the group that they meant to be authorizing force-- again, in part, because ISIL and even Al-Qaeda in Iraq-- as it used to be called by the United States-- didn't exist in 2001.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): And this group, just because it once had some association with Al-Qaeda that did exist in 2001, isn't it.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): You know, the United States is an offshoot of Great Britain in some fundamental way, but I'd like to think, after a certain time and a certain set of disagreements, you can tell the difference--
John Donvan (role: mod): But do--
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): --between one and another.
John Donvan (role: mod): Deborah, do you concede the sameness argument, that they're-- they might be somewhat different people, different name, but that their game is the same?
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): I don't.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): In fact, it's not just a name.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): It's a fundamental mission.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): So, when Al-Qaeda attacked us on 9/11 and before, Osama Bin Laden named the United States its primary enemy.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): He declared war against the United States.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): He attacked the United States repeatedly.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): He viewed the United States and its political operations and factions in the Middle East as the source of the problem.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): ISIL is in essence an apocalyptic cult.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): They fight the United States today for the same reason that they fight al-Qaeda today, because they believe that they are not true believers of Islamism in the way they believe it should be practiced, and they do not take the United States as its enemy per se any more than they take anyone else.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): In other words, it’s not just the name that’s different, the mission of the group--
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me take that to your opponent.
John Donvan (role: mod): Phillip Bobbitt, do you want to respond to that?
Philip Bobbitt (role: against): Sure.
Philip Bobbitt (role: against): The current leader of ISIL, the Islamic state, al-Baghdadi, said when he was released from our custody where he'd been for some months, “I'll see you next in New York.”
John Donvan (role: mod): And your silence speaks for the rest of your thought.
John Donvan (role: mod): I'll take it back to Gene Healy.
Gene Healy (role: for): Yeah, the notion that all they did was change their name is not right, as Deborah's pointed out.
Gene Healy (role: for): I'd also say that, as she pointed out, the ISIS strategy is to focus on the near enemy.
Gene Healy (role: for): Al-Qaeda's strategy is to focus on the far enemy.
Gene Healy (role: for): The fact that ISIS has local apocalyptic and monstrous goals may explain-- and the fact that they're locally focused probably helps explain why evey major figure in the national security establishment, from the chairman of the joint chiefs to two heads of the National Counterterrorism Center, has said that there is no evidence that ISIS has plans or major capability to attack the homeland.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 7.0, 'undecided_for': 13.0, 'for_against': 7.0, 'for_for': 19.0, 'undecided_against': 22.0, 'for_undecided': 2.0, 'undecided_undecided': 5.0, 'against_undecided': 2.0, 'against_against': 22.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 9.0, 'for': 38.0, 'against': 53.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 40.0, 'for': 27.0, 'against': 33.0}}",John Donvan,mod,I'll take that to Akhil Amar.

Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): And we just talked about how perfecting it, in the sense of international law, can't be it.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): The president himself says the conflict has gone much beyond that now.

Akhil Reed Amar (role: against): And the answer is zero, okay?
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): We detained people in Guantanamo who were from China.

Gene Healy (role: for): I'd also say that, as she pointed out, the ISIS strategy is to focus on the near enemy.
Gene Healy (role: for): Al-Qaeda's strategy is to focus on the far enemy.

John Donvan (role: mod): Deborah, do you concede the sameness argument, that they're-- they might be somewhat different people, different name, but that their game is the same?
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): I don't.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): In fact, it's not just a name.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): It's a fundamental mission.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): So, when Al-Qaeda attacked us on 9/11 and before, Osama Bin Laden named the United States its primary enemy.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): He declared war against the United States.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): He attacked the United States repeatedly.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): He viewed the United States and its political operations and factions in the Middle East as the source of the problem.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): ISIL is in essence an apocalyptic cult.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): They fight the United States today for the same reason that they fight al-Qaeda today, because they believe that they are not true believers of Islamism in the way they believe it should be practiced, and they do not take the United States as its enemy per se any more than they take anyone else.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): In other words, it’s not just the name that’s different, the mission of the group--
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me take that to your opponent.
John Donvan (role: mod): Phillip Bobbitt, do you want to respond to that?
Philip Bobbitt (role: against): Sure.
Philip Bobbitt (role: against): The current leader of ISIL, the Islamic state, al-Baghdadi, said when he was released from our custody where he'd been for some months, “I'll see you next in New York.”
John Donvan (role: mod): And your silence speaks for the rest of your thought.
John Donvan (role: mod): I'll take it back to Gene Healy.
Gene Healy (role: for): Yeah, the notion that all they did was change their name is not right, as Deborah's pointed out.
Gene Healy (role: for): I'd also say that, as she pointed out, the ISIS strategy is to focus on the near enemy.
Gene Healy (role: for): Al-Qaeda's strategy is to focus on the far enemy.
Gene Healy (role: for): The fact that ISIS has local apocalyptic and monstrous goals may explain-- and the fact that they're locally focused probably helps explain why evey major figure in the national security establishment, from the chairman of the joint chiefs to two heads of the National Counterterrorism Center, has said that there is no evidence that ISIS has plans or major capability to attack the homeland.
John Donvan (role: mod): I'll take that to Akhil Amar.
Akhil Reed Amar (role: against): So, it's about, I think to paraphrase my partner, a broad network of affiliate organizations.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay, respond to Gene's point, though, that this particular group, ISIL, is not necessarily-- actually, stronger than that, that it appears not to be a direct threat to the United States.
Akhil Reed Amar (role: against): Well, the president of the-- that might go to the wisdom of, and proportionality of what sort of force is to be used, but he invoked a lot of people that I don’t actually see in this authorization the use of military force.

Akhil Reed Amar<against>: Professor of Law, Yale University","John Donvan (role: mod): I'll take it back to Gene Healy.
John Donvan (role: mod): And your silence speaks for the rest of your thought.
Philip Bobbitt (role: against): The current leader of ISIL, the Islamic state, al-Baghdadi, said when he was released from our custody where he'd been for some months, “I'll see you next in New York.”
Philip Bobbitt (role: against): Sure.
John Donvan (role: mod): Phillip Bobbitt, do you want to respond to that?
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me take that to your opponent.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): In other words, it’s not just the name that’s different, the mission of the group--
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): They fight the United States today for the same reason that they fight al-Qaeda today, because they believe that they are not true believers of Islamism in the way they believe it should be practiced, and they do not take the United States as its enemy per se any more than they take anyone else.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): ISIL is in essence an apocalyptic cult.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): He viewed the United States and its political operations and factions in the Middle East as the source of the problem.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): He attacked the United States repeatedly.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): He declared war against the United States.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): So, when Al-Qaeda attacked us on 9/11 and before, Osama Bin Laden named the United States its primary enemy.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): It's a fundamental mission.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): In fact, it's not just a name.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): I don't.
John Donvan (role: mod): Deborah, do you concede the sameness argument, that they're-- they might be somewhat different people, different name, but that their game is the same?
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): --between one and another.
John Donvan (role: mod): But do--
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): You know, the United States is an offshoot of Great Britain in some fundamental way, but I'd like to think, after a certain time and a certain set of disagreements, you can tell the difference--
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): And this group, just because it once had some association with Al-Qaeda that did exist in 2001, isn't it.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): Congress never conceived that ISIL was the group that they meant to be authorizing force-- again, in part, because ISIL and even Al-Qaeda in Iraq-- as it used to be called by the United States-- didn't exist in 2001.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): The text of the authorization for the use of force doesn't name them.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): So I find the notion, to use the word, absurd.
Deborah Pearlstein (role: for): Sure.
John Donvan (role: mod): Do you want take that, Deborah Pearlstein?
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to take that part of the argument to the team that's arguing for the motion and ask them about that notion: that, in fact, what-- the authorization given to George Bush in 2001 still applies, primarily because we're still fighting the same guys in the same extended war.
John Donvan (role: mod): It was inherited by Barack Obama; that its elasticity is a matter of practicality, because the enemy changes, and it hasn't changed that much; that in a lot of ways, the guys in ISIL are the same people, with the same tactics, and the same target-- us-- as the target that was chosen by Al-Qaeda on September 11th.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion-- Akhil Amar and Philip Bobbitt-- are arguing that indeed the president has the authorization to take the war to ISIL, that it is the same authorization that was given to George Bush in 2001 after September 11th to defeat enemies, such as Al-Qaeda.
John Donvan (role: mod): But presidential actions, like the bombing of Libya, amount to one man unilaterally taking the nation to war without-- in some cases-- justification of true threats to the nation, and that this is not how a constitutional democracy makes the most important decisions that it ever has to face.
John Donvan (role: mod): Congress declares wars, not the president; that this president, President Obama, has taken more license with war- making than any president in history; that ISIL is an enemy in the conventional sense of conventional war, and therefore, all of the normal rules should apply.
John Donvan (role: mod): It's in the Constitution.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing for this motion-- that the president has gone too far-- Deborah Pearlstein and Gene Healy have argued that it's right there in writing.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have this motion in front of us: The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by Waging War Without Congressional Authorization.
John Donvan (role: mod): In Round 2, the debaters address one another in-- directly, and they take questions from me and from you, our live audience here at the Miller Theater at Columbia University.
John Donvan (role: mod): And now we move on to Round 2.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes opening statements in this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate, where our motion is: The President Has Exceeded His Constitutional Authority by Waging War Without Congressional Authorization.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Akhil Amar.
Akhil Reed Amar (role: against): So remember that the authorization of the use of military force that I tried to read slowly and carefully to you addresses not just the original organizations, but any other organizations or persons that aided them or that harbored them, and their successors.
Akhil Reed Amar (role: against): I should've also probably said it's the same basic theater of war and the same geographic target, namely New York--
John Donvan (role: mod): Is that relevant?

Patrick Lang (role: for): And those are all very complex things, and it’s going to be very expensive over a long period of time.
James Shinn (role: against): But the risk here I think, is that the counterinsurgency clock moves at a slower pace than the political clock.

Steven Clemons (role: for): —I mean, binary debates, are always complicated but I hope we can stay away from sloganeering, I’m not there—the other day General David Patraeus said that one of his concerns, was that people would think that what happened in Iraq would be easily moved— that he thinks all the time about the tyranny of the mind, that one would get stuck in one framework that might not approach the others, so General Petraeus actually raised many of the same questions that we are about the applicability of the counterintelligence—but let’s take your manual for a minute, your manual as you know, and I’ve learned a lot about it from you, argues for a forced deployment which is staggering, but more important, of that staggering force deployment it argues that of the resources deployed, 80 percent of those should be civilian, 20 percent should be military.

Patrick Lang (role: for): No, it would work.
John Nagl (role: against): Will Not Succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan” (10/6/09)
John Nagl (role: against): And why would that not work again in Afghanistan, Patrick.
Patrick Lang (role: for): And that had a devastating effect once it was put into effect against al-Qaeda—
Patrick Lang (role: for): And that some of these people were only, as it was said economic insurgents, and that they could be split off and used against the other ones.
Patrick Lang (role: for): And that is in fact that we looked at our enemies and instead of believing that they were all one thing as had been advocated for three or four of the first years of the war, we actually looked at them and decided they were many different things.
Patrick Lang (role: for): But I would submit to you that what really worked out in Anbar, in the places where he said-- in other places in Iraq-- was the fact that we adopted a very simple, old-fashioned tool that has been used in the Middle East from time immemorial and often by the colonial powers.
Patrick Lang (role: for): That was certainly useful in the Baghdad area in the context of Iraqi neighborhoods that had been largely cleansed ethnically or at least in a sectarian way, and then a lotta walls were built to separate these people, that worked very well indeed.
Patrick Lang (role: for): The surge, what was the surge, an increase of 30,000 troops or so, in Iraq for some period of time?
Patrick Lang (role: for): With regard to Iraq, with the greatest of respect to Colonel Nagl, I would submit in fact that whatever it is that people call the surge, people are creating these fanciful concepts with single words as a public relations gimmick.
Patrick Lang (role: for): And as I said, we had a varying pattern of success depending on how tough the opposition was and how long we were Will Not Succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan” (10/6/09) willing to stick with it.
Patrick Lang (role: for): In fact these words inscribed in that manual are in fact the same doctrine that we used in the 1960s and ‘70s across the world.
Patrick Lang (role: for): Well, to begin with, it was, I did appreciate the fact that sacred scripture was brought to the meeting here so it could be read to us.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now, without turning this into a discussion about Iraq…tell me why John Nagl is wrong about success with counterintelligence, counterinsurgency measures.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to start, by bringing something I heard from John Nagl over to Patrick Lang, Patrick Lang, you are a generation ahead of John Nagl, you’re both military men, you did counterinsurgency work, and you don’t seem to believe that the methods work very well and yet John Nagl comes in here, he actually brings along the manual…with the techniques and the rules and tells us that we have seen it work, in Iraq.
John Donvan (role: mod): It’ll go on for about 40, 45 minutes.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now on to Round 2, this is our middle round where we mix things up a little bit now, our two teams get to debate head to head, and they will also be responding to questions from me, and questions from you.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they are…before the debate, 48 Will Not Succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan” (10/6/09) percent are for the motion, 25 percent against, and 27 percent undecided, and again we will ask you to vote at the end of the debate and the team that has moved the most votes, that has changed the most minds, will be declared our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes Round 1 of this Intelligence Squared US debate where the motion being argued is “America Cannot and Will Not Succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan.” And as the debate began we asked all of the members of our live audience who are our judges in this debate to vote, to tell us where they stood on this motion before hearing the arguments, and we now have the results of that preliminary vote.

John Donvan (role: mod): Eli Pariser.
Eli Pariser (role: for): There is one-- first off, the reason that it's so hard to study this stuff is because the easiest way to study it is to get inside the black box of these companies.
Eli Pariser (role: for): But it's very hard to look at from the outside, which is why there's just not many studies that haven't been, as Jacob said, you know, funded by Facebook, funded by Microsoft, funded by the companies themselves.
Eli Pariser (role: for): And it's pretty clear.
Eli Pariser (role: for): He looked at how a search history affects the personalization you get.
Eli Pariser (role: for): But actually, the study that's the most interesting here is the Gentzkow study that Jacob was referring to.
Eli Pariser (role: for): And the interesting thing is that if you dig into that study, it actually arguably shows the exact opposite.
Eli Pariser (role: for): And so the isolation index for cable news that that study used was about 3.3.
Eli Pariser (role: for): And so it's twice as polarizing as polarized as cable news.
Eli Pariser (role: for): So the main thing that that study was looking at was the fact that a lot of people, their online serving patterns lead them to Yahoo!
Eli Pariser (role: for): out to a whole bunch of ideologically diverse links.
Eli Pariser (role: for): 's changed since 2007, since that study was written.
Eli Pariser (role: for): looks at your history on what links you've clicked at in the past and sends different people out in different directions.
Eli Pariser (role: for): One more though.
Eli Pariser (role: for): Which is that the other thing that's changed since that study was done is the rise of social media as one of the primary ways that people get information.

Evgeny Morozov (role: against): Again, you have to understand that this is a very particular context in which I think warning people about certain types of websites, which has nothing to do with socialization, has everything to do with certain publishers publishing deliberately misleading information about vaccination, for example, or about the risks of flu vaccines or any other sort of vaccine, and I think it would not be a bad idea for Google to show that there are sites which have actually been approved through peer review and through normal scientific practice and-- to show that, ""Hey, you actually have sites which you can trust.""

John Donvan (role: mod): As long as the political spectrum is covered overall, what’s wrong with that?
Eli Pariser (role: for): Just a little story, when I was on the book tour for my book, I was on a radio show in St. Louis.
Eli Pariser (role: for): It was a really boring radio hour.
Eli Pariser (role: for): And I was thinking, this is the worse book promotion I’ve ever done.
Eli Pariser (role: for): And the second link is also a link to a website about how he doesn’t have a birth certificate.
Eli Pariser (role: for): Oh, I was wondering about that.
Eli Pariser (role: for): But he didn’t even know that that was the view that he was getting.
Eli Pariser (role: for): And that’s sort of the challenge.
Eli Pariser (role: for): And it’s really kind of funny to me, because if you talk to these companies and if you listen to what they’re saying, all of these companies are very clear that personalization is a big part of what they’re doing and what they're--
Evgeny Morozov (role: against): They are very clear.

Jacob Weisberg (role: against): I do not think there is actually the kind of variety you’re talking in searches done most of the time by most people.
Siva Vaidhyanathan (role: for): So, doing social science online is really hard because almost nothing is replicable.
Siva Vaidhyanathan (role: for): For the simple reason that both Facebook and Google are constantly changing their algorithms, constantly tweaking their algorithms for reasons we can’t possibly understand and are not allowed to understand.
Siva Vaidhyanathan (role: for): There are some searches that are more personalized than other searches.
Siva Vaidhyanathan (role: for): There are some ways that you can generate different searches because there are certain keywords that matter more in certain geographic locations than others.

Eli Pariser (role: for): On the internet, the internet had a 7-- an isolation index of 7.
Eli Pariser (role: for): What they did was they created an isolation index for each different kind of medium.
Eli Pariser (role: for): This is a study that was sort of initially described as a study that showed that people are linking to each other and that the internet isn't as polarizing as we thought.

John Donvan (role: mod): Keep in mind how you voted at the beginning of the evening, because we’re going to ask you to vote again at the end and the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now we go on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): Round two is where the debaters address each other directly and also answer questions from you in the audience and from me.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two, who are arguing over this motion, ""When it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds.""
John Donvan (role: mod): The side arguing for the motion, Eli Pariser and Siva Vaidhyanathan.
John Donvan (role: mod): They’re arguing that the internet is actually several internets, that they put up walls between the lands that are occupied by people of differing opinions, between nations as much as between liberals and conservatives.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that especially with customization, designed to give us what we want, that the internet is getting worse at bringing together people who are not like minded.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Jacob Weisberg and Evgeny Morozov, they’re saying sure, maybe these bad things could happen someday but there’s not much evidence that they are happening a lot yet right now.
John Donvan (role: mod): And besides a tool that can and does connect strangers globally around the world by definition, almost, is a good thing.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that customization, perhaps helps to organize the way that we think.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I want to put a question to the side that is arguing against the motion, that when it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds.
John Donvan (role: mod): Jacob Weisberg, you said as your sort of slam dunk point to the audience, you have to decide whether you think the audience is closing your mind.
John Donvan (role: mod): But if the other guys are right, they won’t know whether the audience is closing their minds because if their minds are being closed, part of having their minds closed is not knowing that their minds are being closed.
John Donvan (role: mod): I mean, but they're saying that it's an insidious thing, that it's a stealth thing, particularly with the customization, that it happens in a way that it comes to you-- you go through this process unawares.
John Donvan (role: mod): Can you take that on?
Jacob Weisberg (role: against): Well, this is the minds in a vat--
John Donvan (role: mod): Are you-- I'm sorry.
Jacob Weisberg (role: against): This is the minds in a vat argument in philosophy, that if we were not actually embodied, but have our minds in vats being manipulated by space aliens, we have no way to know.
Jacob Weisberg (role: against): I'm not sure I can answer that.
Jacob Weisberg (role: against): But I do think-- Siva made this point that, well, for those of us in this room, this really isn't a problem.
Jacob Weisberg (role: against): I mean, we're media savvy.
Jacob Weisberg (role: against): We're educated.
Jacob Weisberg (role: against): We're sophisticated.
Jacob Weisberg (role: against): It's a bit-- it's a problem for the hoi polloi out there, the unwashed masses who, you know, are just getting spoon fed whatever they get fed.
Jacob Weisberg (role: against): I find that argument condescending.
Jacob Weisberg (role: against): I mean, we live in a democracy, and it seems to me that we're all responsible for the information we receive.
Jacob Weisberg (role: against): And not everybody engages as deeply in different subjects.
Jacob Weisberg (role: against): But the difference with the internet is we can measure it.
Jacob Weisberg (role: against): You know, we never knew who read the stories in the B section of the New York Times about Albany and the state legislature.
Jacob Weisberg (role: against): On the internet, you know how many people click on them, but that doesn't mean--
John Donvan (role: mod): It’s about 11, I think.
Jacob Weisberg (role: against): Yeah, exactly.
Jacob Weisberg (role: against): But how many people actually read to the end or even the beginning of the story before we had the internet?
John Donvan (role: mod): Well, Siva, take on, number one, Jacob's point that you're, I think, suggesting a little bit of snobbery here, that you're saying, we all can keep up with things, but that there's a great unwashed public out there that can be deceived by the power of these algorithms that are telling them what needs to show up in their searches.
Siva Vaidhyanathan (role: for): I merely meant that Jacob's test, whether it works for you, wasn't a good enough test, largely because you are just you, and you are not we.
Siva Vaidhyanathan (role: for): You are not a greater sample, right?
Siva Vaidhyanathan (role: for): So if we're going to be empirical, let's be good about the social science we deploy.
Siva Vaidhyanathan (role: for): That is the worst possible empirical test, what happens to you.
Siva Vaidhyanathan (role: for): It's almost laughable in its suggestion.
Siva Vaidhyanathan (role: for): So that can't possibly be the test when you address this question.
John Donvan (role: mod): But wasn't your partner using the ""that's what happened to me when I typed in Egypt""?
Eli Pariser (role: for): Let's talk a little bit about the studies about--
John Donvan (role: mod): Eli Pariser.
Eli Pariser (role: for): There is one-- first off, the reason that it's so hard to study this stuff is because the easiest way to study it is to get inside the black box of these companies.
Eli Pariser (role: for): But it's very hard to look at from the outside, which is why there's just not many studies that haven't been, as Jacob said, you know, funded by Facebook, funded by Microsoft, funded by the companies themselves.
Eli Pariser (role: for): And it's pretty clear.
Eli Pariser (role: for): He looked at how a search history affects the personalization you get.
Eli Pariser (role: for): But actually, the study that's the most interesting here is the Gentzkow study that Jacob was referring to.
Eli Pariser (role: for): And the interesting thing is that if you dig into that study, it actually arguably shows the exact opposite.
Eli Pariser (role: for): And so the isolation index for cable news that that study used was about 3.3.
Eli Pariser (role: for): And so it's twice as polarizing as polarized as cable news.","{'breakdown': None, 'post': {'undecided': 11.0, 'for': 53.0, 'against': 36.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 35.0, 'for': 28.0, 'against': 37.0}}",Eli Pariser,for,"So the main thing that that study was looking at was the fact that a lot of people, their online serving patterns lead them to Yahoo!"

John Donvan (role: mod): But if the other guys are right, they won’t know whether the audience is closing their minds because if their minds are being closed, part of having their minds closed is not knowing that their minds are being closed.
John Donvan (role: mod): Jacob Weisberg, you said as your sort of slam dunk point to the audience, you have to decide whether you think the audience is closing your mind.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I want to put a question to the side that is arguing against the motion, that when it comes to politics, the internet is closing our minds.

John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Jacob Weisberg and Evgeny Morozov, they’re saying sure, maybe these bad things could happen someday but there’s not much evidence that they are happening a lot yet right now.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that especially with customization, designed to give us what we want, that the internet is getting worse at bringing together people who are not like minded.

Anant Agarwal (role: for): not comparing-- I'm not comparing you.
John Donvan (role: mod): But I'm with Anant on his point being let's put aside the impact on you and how discouraging that would be to you.
Rebecca Schuman (role: against): Of having a robot grade their papers?
Rebecca Schuman (role: against): They’d learn how to game the robot immediately.
Jonathan Cole (role: against): Even the most conservative organization in the world, the college board and the SAT, are giving up the essay part of the SAT examinations, because they are doing the grading by rote, in effect.
Jonathan Cole (role: against): They're not teaching students how to think for themselves independently, which is a very difficult thing to do.
Ben Nelson (role: for): Well, and again, I do think that we're ratholing on a piece of content.
Ben Nelson (role: for): I mean, I do think that at the very high levels of education you do want people who are expert in the subject to grade essays.
Ben Nelson (role: for): To say the professor doesn't sit in front of a lecture hall or even a 10-person class and says hold on a second while I read this paper and grade it, that's not a very interactive format.
Ben Nelson (role: for): And so the question is what is the cost structure that is going to be built around actually disseminating that education?
Ben Nelson (role: for): Even in the scenario we believe in.
Ben Nelson (role: for): We still opt to use chronology to facilitate the goings on in the classroom, because we think that it can enhance the experience for the student and dramatically lower the cost where you don't need to build buildings and maintain campuses when you can gather the students and have them experience what the world has to offer as opposed to necessarily in a very expensive, very exclusive campus environment.
Jonathan Cole (role: against): Well, I mean first of all, I think that, you know, educators have done a terrible job, especially at the selective colleges dealing with the issue of costs.
Jonathan Cole (role: against): They have a tremendous endowment.
Jonathan Cole (role: against): So it's not as if those who can't afford it who come from, you know, poor socio-economic backgrounds can't go to these great colleges.

John Donvan (role: mod): I think it's relevant because she's actually giving a reason why she needs to be there in the classroom, kind of running things.

John Donvan (role: mod): What's your response to that?
John Donvan (role: mod): Well, let's find out.
Anant Agarwal (role: for): I'm referring to all the children and students who cannot afford college or that leave college with huge amounts of debt or that simply don't have access to college.
Jonathan Cole (role: against): And that's a wonderful aim and a wonderful objective that I actually fully endorse, but the evidence that I've seen, and it's bad-- you know, it's not particularly good evidence, empirical evidence, suggests that the people in remote places that can't get to MIT, can't get to, you know, Amherst or Williams or wherever it might be, are people who are already educated.
John Donvan (role: mod): Is that correct-- Anant, is that correct?
Anant Agarwal (role: for): So we have 2.2 million learners on edX and of that, 30 percent of the 600,000 are high school and college students.
Anant Agarwal (role: for): And so we cannot-- so we really cannot say that we're not reaching students in the right demographic.
Ben Nelson (role: for): And I would add to Anant's point that if these universities would actually issue a degree alongside with that, you wouldn't have 600,000 students, you'd have 60 million.
Ben Nelson (role: for): That was good enough.
Ben Nelson (role: for): But there is no point except for interest right now.
Rebecca Schuman (role: against): Well, you know, yes, I think that it does-- the numbers are-- it does reach more people than not having it would reach.
Rebecca Schuman (role: against): And that shows in the corporate directions of edX's two main competitors, Coursera and Udacity, both of whom have decided to concentrate on corporate training instead of the sort of loftier democratization of education.
Rebecca Schuman (role: against): There-- you know, you - - I love that you think that I'm irreplaceable and that everybody should just be in my class, but I am not that special.
John Donvan (role: mod): And what happens to you million if their world comes true?

Rebecca Schuman (role: against): I don't teach online at UMSLwhere I teach right now, but I have colleagues who do.

John Donvan (role: mod): What's your response to that?
John Donvan (role: mod): It's not a letter through the mail to your professor with your answers.
John Donvan (role: mod): It truly is two-way.
John Donvan (role: mod): That the game changer, Rebecca Schuman, your opponents are saying, is that it's interactive this time.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay, let me put that to the other side.
Ben Nelson (role: for): This is an interactive medium.
Ben Nelson (role: for): It's broadcast.
Ben Nelson (role: for): It's not interactive.
John Donvan (role: mod): Why not?
Ben Nelson (role: for): Correct.
John Donvan (role: mod): But let me stop you there, Ben, just in the interest of time, because my point is that that has not had much impact on the university model, which your partner says hasn't changed forever.
Ben Nelson (role: for): And the eye naturally learns to read those subtitles.
Ben Nelson (role: for): For example, in India, it's something like a hundred million people have learned to read from a program that adds subtitles to Indian soap operas.
Ben Nelson (role: for): What the radio has done, and television has done, to teach people and some of the information has been dramatic.
Ben Nelson (role: for): Think of the general population educational level in the 1930s around the world.
Ben Nelson (role: for): And I think you have to understand the context.
Ben Nelson (role: for): Well, I would argue it has helped.
John Donvan (role: mod): Why is it different this time, Ben Nelson?
John Donvan (role: mod): We've heard that technology was going to change the game dramatically so many times in the past.
John Donvan (role: mod): And the radio courses, et cetera.
John Donvan (role: mod): The open university in the United Kingdom, no, there were people who had degrees for that, but the great universities of England haven't flinched whatsoever.
John Donvan (role: mod): Correspondence courses were going to democratize education, and they didn't.
John Donvan (role: mod): As you pointed out in the opening, we have heard this before.
John Donvan (role: mod): So I want to put the question to this side that's arguing for the motion and making that point that we're at the dawn of a new era.
John Donvan (role: mod): Particularly since the side arguing for the motion is saying, well, we're at the dawn of a new era, and you have to see how much it can improve.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I think some of that emphasis has to do with faith in technology itself to solve some of the problems.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I think in the emphasis there is a wide gulf.
John Donvan (role: mod): So let's make it clear that this is not this kind of fight to the death over this issue, but it is a discussion over emphasis.
John Donvan (role: mod): And the Minerva Project that Ben Nelson is sponsoring builds that in.
John Donvan (role: mod): They concede that around the margin, the team arguing against concedes that around the margins, sure, some online education can be supplemental and useful, and the team on the other side is saying, sure, there needs to be a way to have human contact.
John Donvan (role: mod): And the team on the other side is not saying, ""No clicks ever.""
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing more clicks, fewer bricks, is not saying, no bricks ever again.
John Donvan (role: mod): Neither team is deep into their corner where they don't see merit in the other side's argument.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now, I want to point out that there is a level of nuance to this debate.
John Donvan (role: mod): They argue that too much of an education-- too much of education is not just about the answers in the book, but it's about what develops over time in an intimate, close contact, that that is critical and that software can't be the answer for everybody.
John Donvan (role: mod): Contact is critical, said Rebecca Schuman.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Rebecca Schuman and Jonathan Cole, they have argued-- they put it this way: People learn from each other said Jonathan Cole.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say that it can improve dramatically and cash up in a field of academia where nothing has changed for eons, that there's an advantage in fact to being able to stop a professor and wind and rewind and even silence, if you want to, that there's a generation now, the millennial generation who are essentially wired to learn this way, that it will connect to them, that there are different learning styles and that the technology can adapt to all of them, that technology allows that.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have argued that critics of online education are looking at the flaws in how it is now and failing to see the potential that it has at the era that this is now only the dawn of.
John Donvan (role: mod): Arguing for the motion, we've heard from Anant Agarwal and Ben Nelson.
John Donvan (role: mod): The motion is, ""more clicks, fewer bricks: The lecture hall is obsolete.""
John Donvan (role: mod): And round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you in the live audience.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now we move on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): And again, to remind you, the team whose numbers have changed the most will be declared our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): We're going to have you vote again after you hear all of the arguments.
John Donvan (role: mod): Remember now how you voted in-- just before the debate began.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where our motion is ""more clicks, fewer bricks: The lecture hall is obsolete.""
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Rebecca Schuman.
Jonathan Cole (role: against): Well, I'd like to just quote from Sherry Turkle who wrote a wonderful little book called ""Alone Together.""
Jonathan Cole (role: against): And she said, ""technology is seductive when what it offers meets our human vulnerabilities.""
Jonathan Cole (role: against): We are lonely but fearful of intimacy.
Jonathan Cole (role: against): Our networked life allows us to hide from each other even as we are tethered to each other which I think often is reflected in the social media and the kinds of contacts that people make through technology.

Rebecca Schuman (role: against): Of having a robot grade their papers?
Rebecca Schuman (role: against): They’d learn how to game the robot immediately.
Jonathan Cole (role: against): Even the most conservative organization in the world, the college board and the SAT, are giving up the essay part of the SAT examinations, because they are doing the grading by rote, in effect.
Jonathan Cole (role: against): They're not teaching students how to think for themselves independently, which is a very difficult thing to do.
Ben Nelson (role: for): Well, and again, I do think that we're ratholing on a piece of content.
Ben Nelson (role: for): I mean, I do think that at the very high levels of education you do want people who are expert in the subject to grade essays.
Ben Nelson (role: for): To say the professor doesn't sit in front of a lecture hall or even a 10-person class and says hold on a second while I read this paper and grade it, that's not a very interactive format.
Ben Nelson (role: for): And so the question is what is the cost structure that is going to be built around actually disseminating that education?
Ben Nelson (role: for): Even in the scenario we believe in.
Ben Nelson (role: for): We still opt to use chronology to facilitate the goings on in the classroom, because we think that it can enhance the experience for the student and dramatically lower the cost where you don't need to build buildings and maintain campuses when you can gather the students and have them experience what the world has to offer as opposed to necessarily in a very expensive, very exclusive campus environment.
Jonathan Cole (role: against): Well, I mean first of all, I think that, you know, educators have done a terrible job, especially at the selective colleges dealing with the issue of costs.
Jonathan Cole (role: against): They have a tremendous endowment.
Jonathan Cole (role: against): So it's not as if those who can't afford it who come from, you know, poor socio-economic backgrounds can't go to these great colleges.

John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams arguing for and against, the team arguing for, Joe Joffe, and Peter Zeihan-- I've said we've heard this whole declinist thing before.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Chrystia Freeland and Jim Rickards, much more pessimistic while saying that they argue that with sadness, but that to point out the flaws in the system are-- is, in itself, an act of patriotism.
John Donvan (role: mod): It sounds to me that there are areas in which the two of you agree on some of the basics, for example, the relative strengths and weaknesses internationally between the United States and some of its rivals.
John Donvan (role: mod): That there's this fragility that over time is going to undermine much of the American dream.
John Donvan (role: mod): Peter Zeihan, your opponent, Chrystia Freeland, argued that the American middleclass is really just in a corner that it can't get out of, both because of the way things are running economically and because of political gridlock, that-- and that-- that they're-- that in itself is the reason that you-- that they can argue right now not to bet on America because of the critical role that the American middleclass has played in building America.
Peter Zeihan (role: for): Well, actually, the data doesn't support that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay, Joe Joffe, do you want to take that?
Josef Joffe (role: for): I don't think it has anything to do with the issue whether the country itself is declining, but let's go with the issue of equality.
Josef Joffe (role: for): And lo and behold, you'll be surprised.
Josef Joffe (role: for): Total inequality will be one.
Josef Joffe (role: for): The great state of Canada has a genie coefficient of 0.34.
Josef Joffe (role: for): Italy almost 0.4.
Josef Joffe (role: for): Do not talk anecdotes and repeat what you read every other day in ""The New York Times.""
James Rickards (role: against): The Gini coefficient point.
James Rickards (role: against): That's a little like saying it's a nice day except for the three feet of snow.
James Rickards (role: against): So yes, with taxes and transfers.
James Rickards (role: against): But not taking into account taxes and transfers, we're actually worse than Mexico.
Josef Joffe (role: for): You can’t argue both sides.
Chrystia Freeland (role: against): No.
John Donvan (role: mod): Chrystia Freeland.
Chrystia Freeland (role: against): That what we have seen over the past 30 years is an increase in inequality in the United States, an increase, a huge increase in the share of income taken by the top 1 percent and 0.1 percent and a stagnation of incomes and wealth of people in the middle.
Chrystia Freeland (role: against): In this case America isn't the cleanest dirty shirt on the stagnate middle class.
Chrystia Freeland (role: against): I completely agree with that, but it is--
Chrystia Freeland (role: against): Hang on, Joe.
Chrystia Freeland (role: against): It is a particular problem for the United States for two reasons.
Chrystia Freeland (role: against): And for the western world to figure it out, we're going to need a strong American lead and we're going to need America to accept that this is a problem.
Josef Joffe (role: for): Let me respond?

Edward Conard (role: against): Well, I'll go back to one point, which is take, for example, test prep that we've talked about and how much parents are preparing.
Edward Conard (role: against): There's prestigious colleges which have a limited number of slots, and then there's other colleges which basically have an unlimited number of slots.
Edward Conard (role: against): And as a result, what you find is that rich white students are working harder and harder for a limited number of slots in the most prestigious schools.
Edward Conard (role: against): At the same time, at the low-- at the less prestigious schools, anybody who's capable of going, who takes the test and is able to get through the school, can go to those schools.
Edward Conard (role: against): We've increased the number of slots.
Edward Conard (role: against): So, it would be unfair, for example, to say, ""Gee, there's more and more rich students going to those schools than there are poor schools-- poor students today.""

John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to go to Elise Gould who's arguing for the motion and-- and your opponent's point is that the studies show us something that's not intuitively correct.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, I found it interesting that Scott Winship, who is arguing against the motion, said that the motion as phrased, Income Inequality Impairs the American Dream of Upward Mobility, sounds intuitively correct, but is factually wrong.
John Donvan (role: mod): But they say the success of the top earners in America is not to blame for America's problems.
John Donvan (role: mod): They cite a number of studies that have looked at this and have crunched the numbers, comparing income inequality with the mobility and they find that there is no meaningful relationship and that the downward pressure on wages in the United States, which they acknowledge is real, has other causes.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say compared to other nations where income is much flatter, that the United States has greater mobility.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Scott Winship and Ed Conard also acknowledge that there is a lot of-- also acknowledge that there is a lot of income inequality, but they say that is not the cause of a loss in upward mobility in the United States.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say, basically, using the image of a ladder, that if the rungs are spread farther apart than they ever have been before and the top is higher than it's ever been before that intuitively, it becomes much more difficult to climb, that the distance from the bottom to the top has become staggering.
John Donvan (role: mod): That if you can't buy eyeglasses for the kid in school, then the kid's not going to do well in school, and his opportunity will be limited.
John Donvan (role: mod): They talked about how low income families cannot invest in their kids' futures.

John Donvan (role: mod): But they say the success of the top earners in America is not to blame for America's problems.

Scott Winship<against>: Fellow, Manhattan Institute","Elise Gould (role: for): Yep.
Elise Gould (role: for): If--
Elise Gould (role: for): Right.
Elise Gould (role: for): So if we had had, let's say from the late '50s to the mid '70s, we had economic growth that was associated with falling poverty rates.
Elise Gould (role: for): So, this is absolutely a discussion about the size of the pie, not just the size of the pie, but the distribution of those resources of the pie.
Elise Gould (role: for): If we were to look at what happened to middle income families, and my research shows that if you were to look at sort of the wedge that's created by this growing inequality, that the typical family today would be making 18,000 more dollars in just one year.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): What I think I hear Elise saying is, it's not-- the relevant issue is not that there are a lot of people that are very rich, it's that there are a lot of people that are very poor, that that level of inequality, those depths are very, very difficult to move out of and therefore there is immobility at that-- at that level.
Scott Winship (role: against): But it's lower than-- quite a bit lower than it was in the 196--
Scott Winship (role: against): I'm sorry?
Scott Winship (role: against): It's probably-- you know, I am fortunate enough not to have grown up poor, I'm guessing it's still very difficult to escape.
Scott Winship (role: against): But the question on the table, I think, is whether income inequality is behind that.
Scott Winship (role: against): So one reason I think that you might worry about rising inequality is if the attainments of the poor were actually getting worse.
Scott Winship (role: against): Test scores have risen among the poor.
Scott Winship (role: against): The problem is that in a lot of cases it's risen faster at the top.
Scott Winship (role: against): I think it's always been tough to be poor, but I don't think it's tougher today because the top 1 percent share has gone from a very high 10 percent to an even higher 24 percent.
John Donvan (role: mod): And in your opening remarks, you made the argument that that just doesn't make sense.
Nick Hanauer (role: for): We're in violent agreement about that our economy benefits massively from very clever and very hard working people taking risks and innovating.
Nick Hanauer (role: for): The question is, should only a few percent of us be able to do that.
Nick Hanauer (role: for): I mean, look, here's the way to connect these two things.
Nick Hanauer (role: for): Well, here's a reason, because over the last 40 years, the percent of profits that American corporations generate as a percentage of GDP, has gone from 6 to 12 percent.
Nick Hanauer (role: for): So that difference is about a trillion dollars annually.
Nick Hanauer (role: for): That trillion dollars isn't profit because it needs to be or should be or has to be.
Nick Hanauer (role: for): That trillion dollars could very easily be spent on wages.
Nick Hanauer (role: for): This isn't a consequence of some magical law of economics.
Nick Hanauer (role: for): And the thing is-- the thing is, is that if that trillion dollars was, instead of stuck in my bank account and Ed's bank account, but instead was coursing through the economy as wages and opportunity, we'd have more innovators, we'd have more risk-takers.
Nick Hanauer (role: for): If you set it up right, it works super well.
John Donvan (role: mod): Ed Conard.
Edward Conard (role: against): But it isn't true.
Edward Conard (role: against): Apple will create an iPhone, and Samsung will come up with a competition, and Microsoft will scramble to fix their problem.
Edward Conard (role: against): And the people who are generating that investment-- the money that Nick's saving which is funding those investments causes a lot of other consumption in our economy and puts a lot of other people to work.
Edward Conard (role: against): ""Germany, France, Japan, they've all tried it, they all distribute income more equally, and they are not able to achieve the median incomes that we achieve in the United States.
Edward Conard (role: against): Because there's another economic truth that they don't want to admit to which is you have to get a customer to pay somebody $18,000 more a year to buy the product to pay them that.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 2.0, 'undecided_for': 11.0, 'for_against': 15.0, 'for_for': 40.0, 'undecided_against': 11.0, 'for_undecided': 5.0, 'undecided_undecided': 4.0, 'against_undecided': 0.0, 'against_against': 10.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 10.0, 'for': 53.0, 'against': 37.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 26.0, 'for': 60.0, 'against': 14.0}}",John Donvan,mod,All right.

Elise Gould (role: for): And you brought up some research about Miles Corak.
Elise Gould (role: for): But the paper that I cited earlier, that family background is twice as important in determining children's success in the U.S. as in Canada is also from a Miles Corak paper from this year.
Elise Gould (role: for): Kids from low income families are far more likely to be low income.
Elise Gould (role: for): And I want to respond to one other thing that Ed said about transfers in resources.
Elise Gould (role: for): The idea that we have working poor in this country is-- I just-- I think it just leaves such a bad taste in my mouth, that we have people that are hardworking, working full-time-- maybe full-year-- and they can't lift their families out of poverty.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me stop-- let me stop you--
John Donvan (role: mod): --and just-- and go to Ed, because the question was directed at you.

John Donvan (role: mod): What's your response to that?
Edward Conard (role: against): If you're sick, you're going to have a difficult time.
Edward Conard (role: against): But there are many, many, many people who can lift themselves out of poverty.
Edward Conard (role: against): They were making $2, $3 an hour.
Edward Conard (role: against): Many of them-- many more than that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
Edward Conard (role: against): But I would like--
John Donvan (role: mod): Actually, I want to go back to-- I just wanted to have you-- an interruption to that point.
John Donvan (role: mod): Elise, I just want to come back to you with that question.
John Donvan (role: mod): Conceding that some people can't lift themselves out of poverty, what does that have to do with people being very rich at the top?
Elise Gould (role: for): It hasn't gotten smaller from rising--
Elise Gould (role: for): --income inequality.
Elise Gould (role: for): And if we know that a larger share of the pie is going to the top, that means that there's less there for everybody else.
Elise Gould (role: for): And parents cannot afford to make those investments.
Elise Gould (role: for): Unemployment is more common.
Elise Gould (role: for): And all of those things provide a situation where children just do not have the same opportunities--
John Donvan (role: mod): Scott Winship, in your opening statement, I think I heard you also agree with your opponents.
John Donvan (role: mod): Did I heard you correctly in that?
Scott Winship (role: against): So, the figures that I like to cite, if you are born in the bottom fifth, raised in the bottom fifth, you only have about a 30 to 40 percent chance of making it, either to the middle class or better than that.
Scott Winship (role: against): But it's-- it's a leap to say that the reason for that limited upward mobility is because of income inequality or because income inequality has risen.

Nick Hanauer (role: for): But raising tax rates for private equity investors from the abomination of 15 percent to 39 does not discourage success.

John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go to the team that is arguing against the motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): They also make a philosophical argument that whatever the text of the First Amendment they say that there are values that fight corruption embedded in the Constitution's history and its own philosophy and that those also have standing in this debate.
John Donvan (role: mod): It's the accumulation of power and that this has consequences, particularly when the source of that power, the source of that money is large corporations driven by their own profits.
John Donvan (role: mod): It's actually action.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Burt Neuborne and Zephyr Teachout, they are saying that there can and should be limits on spending for speech in politics because they're arguing that spending is more than just speech.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say if anything, that amendment was conceived to protect political speech which is the essence of self-government.
John Donvan (role: mod): But they say the solution cannot be the limiting of what they spend on that voice because that runs right into something called the First Amendment.
John Donvan (role: mod): They have argued that, yes, very likely the fact that the rich would have more of a voice in a marketplace where there's no limb mitts to spending, they would have that louder voice, and that's a real problem.
John Donvan (role: mod): You've heard the arguments for this motion from Floyd Abrams and Nadine Strossen.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have, in this second round two teams of two debating this motion: Individuals and organizations have a Constitutional right to unlimited spending on their own political speech.
John Donvan (role: mod): And round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you in the audience.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now we go on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): And it's the team whose numbers have changed the most in percentage point terms who will be declared our winner.

Nouriel Roubini (role: against): First of all it wasn’t Wall Street’s fault as much as government.
Nouriel Roubini (role: against): It’s trillion dollars.
Nouriel Roubini (role: against): First of all, it happened because we had totally unsustainable tax cuts in 2001, 2003.

Phil Gramm (role: for): Okay.
Phil Gramm (role: for): Let's--
John Donvan (role: mod): --and leave it at that.
John Donvan (role: mod): So the minute starts now.
Phil Gramm (role: for): First of all, my confidence in freedom is not based on faith.
Phil Gramm (role: for): It's based on evidence.
Phil Gramm (role: for): Two, it's true that Bill Clinton spent the whole campaign attacking me and attacking Gramm-Leach-Bliley.
Phil Gramm (role: for): But when he became president, and he proposed reforming the banking system, how many changes do you think he made in Gramm- Leach-Bliley?
Phil Gramm (role: for): None.
Phil Gramm (role: for): In fact, he strengthened Gramm-Leach-Bliley to require systemically significant companies to become financial services holding companies under Gramm-Leach-Bliley.
Phil Gramm (role: for): So the plain truth is Gramm-Leach-Bliley broad based organizations did better during the financial crisis.
Phil Gramm (role: for): There would have been more failures without the law.
Phil Gramm (role: for): Obama had a chance to change the law, and he didn't do it.
Phil Gramm (role: for): Now, some people would say, well, maybe he wasn't telling the truth to begin with.
Phil Gramm (role: for): I don't think that.
Phil Gramm (role: for): I think he just learned something.
Phil Gramm (role: for): Not everybody did.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Phil Gramm.
John Donvan (role: mod): And you're straying into your real time now, so I'm going to move on to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): Big government is stifling the American spirit, that is our motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): And now we move on to round two where the debaters address each other directly.
John Donvan (role: mod): The side for the motion, Phil Gramm who fought to shrink government when he was in the Senate, and Art Laffer, the man behind the curve, arguing that government ties the hands of the truly creative and innovative, those who would otherwise help grow America and create jobs.
John Donvan (role: mod): The side against the motion “Big government is stifling the American spirit,” Laura Tyson and Nouriel Roubini, insisting that governments and laws are needed both to rescue those who are in trouble and to police those who, left to their own devices, particularly in the world of business, would do much more harm than good and have in the very recent past.
John Donvan (role: mod): We're now going to move to that part of the debate where I ask questions, you ask questions, and the debaters can talk with one another directly.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to go to the issue of substance.
John Donvan (role: mod): To the side that's arguing against the motion, your opponents are proposing a thesis that when the rich are taxed, they stop producing growth.
John Donvan (role: mod): Can you go specifically to that issue, to that thesis which is really the core of their argument, Laura Tyson.
Laura Tyson (role: against): Well, I'm not sure I would agree it is the core of their argument, because I want to say that I think the issue that we need to discuss more is that as a country, we actually, as I said, want the government to spend money.
Laura Tyson (role: against): But then we don't want to pay for it.
Laura Tyson (role: against): And one of the words that was only used here once tonight, but needs to be brought back, is the word entitlement.
Laura Tyson (role: against): And I think it's important to point out right now that according to the CBO, within 15 years entitlements plus net interest will absorb all of the tax revenues of the US government.
Laura Tyson (role: against): We could not do anything else, no education, no technology, no infrastructure, no other government whatsoever.
Laura Tyson (role: against): So I think that as we debate what kind of tax system we're going to have, and I think that's a legitimate area of debate, we also have to address the fact that 78 percent of Americans will say growing costs of entitlements pose a major problem for the United States.
Laura Tyson (role: against): But if you ask them what to do about it, 56 percent say no tax increases to solve the problem.
Laura Tyson (role: against): 66 percent say no benefit cuts to solve the problem.
Laura Tyson (role: against): A third of the people say no change whatsoever to solve the problem, a big problem, but not my problem.
Laura Tyson (role: against): And I do think we have to ask ourselves the question of if we want to spend on programs, how are we going to finance them?
John Donvan (role: mod): But how about the question I asked here?
Laura Tyson (role: against): But I think-- I'm happy to answer that question-- but I honestly think it's--
Laura Tyson (role: against): Yes, go ahead.
Nouriel Roubini (role: against): When Clinton came to power, he raised the marginal tax rate from 35 to 39 percent.
Nouriel Roubini (role: against): Guess what?
Nouriel Roubini (role: against): And then-- and then, when Bush came to power, he reduced these taxes.
Nouriel Roubini (role: against): We had a huge budget deficit.
Nouriel Roubini (role: against): So where is the evidence?
Arthur Laffer (role: for): Yeah.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): Let's take Bill Clinton.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): And I voted for Bill Clinton twice, and God knows I didn't vote in that party's primary.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): Little bit of a problem as a person.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): But he pushed NAFTA through Congress against his own party, against the unions.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): I took my hat off to him there.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): If you were between the ages of 65 and 72, every dollar you earned in Social Security-- is earned, you lost 50 cents in Social Security benefits.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): If you look at it, Clinton reappointed Reagan's Fed chairman twice, brought the long-term bond yield way, way down.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): If you look at what Clinton did, he passed welfare reform, signed into law welfare reform, that you actually have to look for a job to get welfare.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): Clinton also had the biggest capital gains tax cut in our nation's history.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): If you look at Clinton, the one thing I really like most of all about Bill Clinton is he cut government spending as a share of GDP by the largest amount of any American president ever.

Laura Tyson (role: against): I think that Phil Gramm has put out some interesting ideas; I think that those are ideas which a lot of people would disagree with.
Laura Tyson (role: against): And on the issue of-- just on the issue of making Social Security solvent, the 75-year actuarial hole is basically the same size as the Bush tax cuts.
Laura Tyson (role: against): And remember, as Nouriel said, going back to the Clinton level tax rates would go back to levels of rates that coincided with the most prosperous peacetime period in U.S. economic history.
Laura Tyson (role: against): It is a way to pay for the actuarial shortfall of Social Security.

Laura Tyson (role: against): So those are not tax rates that are going to stifle the American spirit.

John Donvan (role: mod): All right, team—team—
Fareed Zakaria (role: for): If it goes away from Mexico we will be back here next year, and we will be talking about, you know, the drug war in Peru, or somewhere else, because, the supply—Asa Hutchinson, as a Republican you surely believe, that, if there is a huge amount of demand from the richest country in the world, somebody is going to figure out a way to supply it.
Fareed Zakaria (role: for): What we are talking about fundamentally is, these countries, among the poorer countries in the world, they are trying to fulfill insatiable demand for $65 billion of product.
Fareed Zakaria (role: for): I think it just proves that this is all kabuki.
Fareed Zakaria (role: for): So then they do that, and Jorge Castañeda says, that’s the problem.
Fareed Zakaria (role: for): And more fundamentally it seems as though there is a contradiction here which is…Asa Hutchinson says, the problem, the reason Mexico has become this hellhole is because it did not declare war on drugs and did not prosecute efficiently and did not take the fight to the enemy.
Fareed Zakaria (role: for): I mean I’ve welcomed diversity but this is ridiculous.

John Donvan (role: mod): So we’ll have you vote once again at the end of the debate, and the team that changes the most minds will be declared our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): Our motion is “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War,” at the start, 43 percent of you were for…22 percent against, and 35 percent undecided.
John Donvan (role: mod): Here are the results where things started at the beginning.
John Donvan (role: mod): You are the judges in this debate, you’re voting both before and again at the end, and the team that changes the most of your minds will be declared our winner.

John Donvan (role: mod): No, let me, I want to go to the libertarian.
Jeffrey A.

Juliette Kayyem (role: for): But if you want to view the War on Terror as solely a legal issue-- the authorization for the use of military force is because of a debate between-- hard to imagine that they actually debated this after September 11th-- is limited to Al-Qaeda and its affiliates.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): So, I didn't bring my legal books.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): I thought the question was, should the War on Terror continue?
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): And I agree with them.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): Because I agree with it.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): --I'm a lawyer, and let me tell you what the AUMF says.
John Donvan (role: mod): Juliette Kayyem.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): Okay, okay--
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): We have this continued legal status of a War on Terror so that everyone doesn't live in constant fear.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): We're at War on Terror.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): So, just, let's be clear.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): That's why you show up to work in the morning and do your job.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): We want people to feel safe.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): Our job is not to make the people feel unsafe in their communities.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): I worked for the NYPD.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): Nothing could be further from the truth.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): That's absolutely not what we're saying.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): But Peter did something once again that he did in his opening remarks, which is try to get you to think that we somehow stand for the proposition that you should live in constant fear forever, and it should never go away.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): Whether we are at war or not is up to the United States and its constitutional authority to decide.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): The direct answer to your question, John, is no, they don't.
Peter Bergen (role: for): --when he was alive.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's hear from Richard Falkenrath.
Peter Bergen (role: for): And for us to sort of live in a state of constant fear that they're going to do something to us is to basically hand them a victory that they didn't even have--
Peter Bergen (role: for): “He's a small man on the wrong side of history.” And history just sped up for them, with the Arab Spring and the death of Bin Laden.
Peter Bergen (role: for): You know, President Obama has said something I think is quite accurate.
Peter Bergen (role: for): He was essentially somebody who history had sidelined.
Peter Bergen (role: for): There was no operation.
Peter Bergen (role: for): But these were not, you know, the government itself-- DHS-- has said you know, that you know, these were-- there was nothing there then.
Peter Bergen (role: for): These were kind of doodlings of a guy was basically spending five years with his three wives, with not much to do-- and thinking about, you know, like, some sort of grotesque parody of a Dr. No James Bond, sort of sitting there, coming up with-- plotting mayhem.
Peter Bergen (role: for): These were blue sky plans.
Peter Bergen (role: for): I think I can tell you right now, that's not going to happen.
Peter Bergen (role: for): I mean, sure, there was often-- when, in Bin Laden's house, in Abbottabad, or after all these blue sky plans to attack us on the 10th anniversary of 9/11.
John Donvan (role: mod): Peter Bergen.
Peter Bergen (role: for): Well, there's a very substantial difference between it--
John Donvan (role: mod): And as long as they're still trying-- as long as it's a war to them, can we say that it's not a war to us?
John Donvan (role: mod): If they are there, and they want to hurt us, and even if Al-Qaeda had been-- had been put on the run, it was clear in the documents that were recovered from Osama Bin Laden's hideout, that they were still trying.
John Donvan (role: mod): And it's this: Do our enemies have any say in telling us whether this is a war or not?
John Donvan (role: mod): So, I want to ask a question to the side that's arguing that it's time to end the War on Terror.
John Donvan (role: mod): And as-- that as long they are there, calling it a war gives the government the tools and the powers that it needs to protect the people.
John Donvan (role: mod): Their view, that there are still enemies out there, dedicated to hurting us.
John Donvan (role: mod): Arguing against the motion-- that it's too soon end the War on Terror-- Michael Hayden and Richard Falkenrath.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing this motion-- “It is Time to End the War on Terror.” The side arguing for that proposition-- Juliette Kayyem and Peter Bergen-- are arguing that it never made sense to call our response to September 11th “The War,” and that in any case, the enemy that provoked that war-- Al-Qaeda-- is now on its last legs.
John Donvan (role: mod): We're here at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, now onto Round 2, where the debaters address each other directly and answer questions from the audience and from me.
John Donvan (role: mod): I really think name pronunciation is entirely unforgivable, so you don't even have to forgive me, okay?
John Donvan (role: mod): I apologize.
John Donvan (role: mod): Yeah.
John Donvan (role: mod): Yeah.
John Donvan (role: mod): And Peter's partner, Juliette Kayyem, who-- in the Obama Administration-- was an Assistant Security for Homeland Security.
John Donvan (role: mod): And so, I'm going to say and then I'd love it if you clapped with as much-- fervor as you did the first time.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I just want to-- not just to be nice-- I want to actually say it again as I said it at the beginning of the program, so that it can be edited correctly into the radio broadcast.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now, before we go on to Round 2, I want to correct a mistake I made in the pronunciation of Juliette’s surname.
John Donvan (role: mod): We're going to ask you to vote again at the end of the debate, and reminding you that the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): Keep in mind how you voted at the top of the evening.
John Donvan (role: mod): Debate, where the motion being argued is, it is time to end the War on Terror.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes Round 1 of this Intelligence Squared U.S.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Mr. Falkenrath.

Juliette Kayyem (role: for): And are we ready to be over?

Juliette Kayyem (role: for): I support that.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): Well, I think it's already over.

John Donvan (role: mod): Michael Hayden.
Michael Hayden (role: against): That all we have been doing-- all that we have done, has been designed against that opposing armed enemy force-- Al-Qaeda and its affiliates.
Michael Hayden (role: against): All along, despite whatever the rhetoric may have been, we used-- again-- the tools of our own conflict against a specific set of enemies, authorized by the Congress of the United States.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that charge-- it does reflect a mindset, a commitment to discussion over resources, a discussion over sacrifice, that talking about a war is a great deal more than the narrow legal sense that you're talking about.

Richard Falkenrath (role: against): We didn't come to work with an identical mindset.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): I think it had a different meaning to me then as a civilian in the White House.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): One of the things about this war-- which is different from, certainly, World War II or Vietnam-- is that the national security apparatus-- and actually a subset of it, feels like it's at war.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): But the people don't.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): So, it hasn't usually been that way for us.
John Donvan (role: mod): So he's saying your definition of war is too subjective.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): Yeah.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): I mean, that was the language of an administration that determined that after 9/11, we would conceive of it at as war.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): And all the-- so, it wasn't just a feeling.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): So let me just give you an example, because that may help-- what this legal debate means.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): So, that's what it is.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): What do we mean by military commissions?
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): Then, we create a whole new military commission system that, under the previous administration, got essentially overturned by the Supreme Court.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): And then you have to say, “What are we going to do with these detainees?” Because it's a problem.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): And then you come back, and you work with Congress, and you create a military commission-- which this president did-- which provides very strong protections for the people within the military commission system, has independent appellate review-- and let's just be clear, has been supported by every Article III court, every federal court in the United States.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): We're just not there.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): It was the language of the AUMF-- authorization for the use of military force against Al-Qaeda and its affiliates.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): So to say now, that we're calling it a feeling seems like it's just a little bit of amnesia there, I think.
Michael Hayden (role: against): Yeah.
Michael Hayden (role: against): Are we a nation at war or not, is the question I would ask.
Michael Hayden (role: against): We've got some commentary here about some things that were done over the last 10 years.

Michael Hayden (role: against): So, don't be confused by the labels.
John Donvan (role: mod): But do you hear your opponent saying that's as a practical matter-- as almost a cultural matter - - the term “war” suggests much more than the issue of a legal authorization-- that it does reflect a mindset, and taking a side is keeping a population in fear.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): Well, it can be, but you need an actionable proposition.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): And when it's so subjective that you're talking about a mindset, it's like - - General Hayden and I showed up in the same government for three years or so.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): We came with slightly different mindsets, and he-- at the time-- was an active military officer.

Juliette Kayyem (role: for): I think that's a weird way to put the War on Terror, only because what followed from calling it a War on Terror-- which was not my language.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): And it would have all sorts of implications-- not just legal implications, but implications for a whole range of activities, because we were going to call it a war.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): It was a series of procedures and policies that flowed from that.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): So by deciding that it's a War on Terror.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): This is the debate about military commissions.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): Well, if it's a War on Terror, that is this thing that we can define and determine where we want to go with detainees or how we want to try or not try them.

Michael Hayden (role: against): And there's some criticisms-- or implied criticisms-- that some of these were overreactions, or not in the best traditions, or novel developments in American constitutional military law.
Michael Hayden (role: against): I am here to suggest that we are not at our best when we are fearful.

Juliette Kayyem (role: for): And we should continue to support it.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): And that is great.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): That's what it does.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): And it gives the President authorization to use a whole bunch of tools-- including military action-- but a whole bunch of them, to fight Al-Qaeda-- those responsible for 9/11-- and its affiliates.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): But if you want to view the War on Terror as solely a legal issue-- the authorization for the use of military force is because of a debate between-- hard to imagine that they actually debated this after September 11th-- is limited to Al-Qaeda and its affiliates.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): So, I didn't bring my legal books.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): I thought the question was, should the War on Terror continue?
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): And I agree with them.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): Because I agree with it.

Juliette Kayyem (role: for): Okay, okay--
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): We have this continued legal status of a War on Terror so that everyone doesn't live in constant fear.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): We're at War on Terror.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): So, just, let's be clear.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): That's why you show up to work in the morning and do your job.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): We want people to feel safe.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): Our job is not to make the people feel unsafe in their communities.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): I worked for the NYPD.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): Nothing could be further from the truth.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): That's absolutely not what we're saying.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): But Peter did something once again that he did in his opening remarks, which is try to get you to think that we somehow stand for the proposition that you should live in constant fear forever, and it should never go away.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): Whether we are at war or not is up to the United States and its constitutional authority to decide.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): The direct answer to your question, John, is no, they don't.
Peter Bergen (role: for): --when he was alive.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's hear from Richard Falkenrath.
Peter Bergen (role: for): And for us to sort of live in a state of constant fear that they're going to do something to us is to basically hand them a victory that they didn't even have--
Peter Bergen (role: for): “He's a small man on the wrong side of history.” And history just sped up for them, with the Arab Spring and the death of Bin Laden.
Peter Bergen (role: for): You know, President Obama has said something I think is quite accurate.
Peter Bergen (role: for): He was essentially somebody who history had sidelined.
Peter Bergen (role: for): There was no operation.
Peter Bergen (role: for): But these were not, you know, the government itself-- DHS-- has said you know, that you know, these were-- there was nothing there then.
Peter Bergen (role: for): These were kind of doodlings of a guy was basically spending five years with his three wives, with not much to do-- and thinking about, you know, like, some sort of grotesque parody of a Dr. No James Bond, sort of sitting there, coming up with-- plotting mayhem.
Peter Bergen (role: for): These were blue sky plans.
Peter Bergen (role: for): I think I can tell you right now, that's not going to happen.
Peter Bergen (role: for): I mean, sure, there was often-- when, in Bin Laden's house, in Abbottabad, or after all these blue sky plans to attack us on the 10th anniversary of 9/11.
John Donvan (role: mod): Peter Bergen.
Peter Bergen (role: for): Well, there's a very substantial difference between it--
John Donvan (role: mod): And as long as they're still trying-- as long as it's a war to them, can we say that it's not a war to us?
John Donvan (role: mod): If they are there, and they want to hurt us, and even if Al-Qaeda had been-- had been put on the run, it was clear in the documents that were recovered from Osama Bin Laden's hideout, that they were still trying.
John Donvan (role: mod): And it's this: Do our enemies have any say in telling us whether this is a war or not?
John Donvan (role: mod): So, I want to ask a question to the side that's arguing that it's time to end the War on Terror.
John Donvan (role: mod): And as-- that as long they are there, calling it a war gives the government the tools and the powers that it needs to protect the people.
John Donvan (role: mod): Their view, that there are still enemies out there, dedicated to hurting us.
John Donvan (role: mod): Arguing against the motion-- that it's too soon end the War on Terror-- Michael Hayden and Richard Falkenrath.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing this motion-- “It is Time to End the War on Terror.” The side arguing for that proposition-- Juliette Kayyem and Peter Bergen-- are arguing that it never made sense to call our response to September 11th “The War,” and that in any case, the enemy that provoked that war-- Al-Qaeda-- is now on its last legs.
John Donvan (role: mod): We're here at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, now onto Round 2, where the debaters address each other directly and answer questions from the audience and from me.
John Donvan (role: mod): I really think name pronunciation is entirely unforgivable, so you don't even have to forgive me, okay?
John Donvan (role: mod): I apologize.
John Donvan (role: mod): Yeah.
John Donvan (role: mod): Yeah.
John Donvan (role: mod): And Peter's partner, Juliette Kayyem, who-- in the Obama Administration-- was an Assistant Security for Homeland Security.
John Donvan (role: mod): And so, I'm going to say and then I'd love it if you clapped with as much-- fervor as you did the first time.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I just want to-- not just to be nice-- I want to actually say it again as I said it at the beginning of the program, so that it can be edited correctly into the radio broadcast.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now, before we go on to Round 2, I want to correct a mistake I made in the pronunciation of Juliette’s surname.

Richard Falkenrath (role: against): But I think I read the proposition a little more closely, because you could have written it like this.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): I think we would have been uncomfortable on this side of the table.
John Donvan (role: mod): Do you assume the audience sees it your way or do you think the audience--
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): And as a--
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): Right.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): Because as we've said, we are currently at war, in a legal sense, and we'd like to frame this proposition, saying, “Should we no longer be?”
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): That's really what it means, “It's time to end the War on Terror.” Now, we could make this a referendum on how this was handled between September 11, 2001 and then the elections of 2006.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): That's a different argument.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): And many of these issues were considered-- this is ironic-- by the Obama Administration.

Richard Falkenrath (role: against): It--
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): --increased.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): A couple things on what Rich says.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): And it's not a referendum on the first four years of the Bush Administration, or the first six years, or even the first two of Obama.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): What was that definition that was used for so many years?
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): And they are doing-- they are trying to convince you, sort of a simplistic notion here, which is-- for those of us who have also served in government and national security is way too simplistic, simply because you want to say that the War on Terror is over does not mean that you're saying, “No military action ever.” Right?
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): There is authority for the President to use force, including killing Bin Laden, under the Authorization for the Use of Military Force.

Juliette Kayyem<for>: Terrorism Specialist and Homeland Security Expert
Richard Falkenrath<against>: Principal, The Chertoff Group & Former Deputy Homeland Security Advisor","Richard Falkenrath (role: against): But why is that
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): First of all, this notion of a War on Terror justified-- and we can get into a legal argument.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): The Authorization for the Use of Military Force was limited both in terms of its target, and did not initiate a War on Terror.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): Their legal analysis-- if you want to talk law-- was actually that because it was a War on Terror, Congress in many ways could not limit the President's authority in a number of items that we can remember-- that we can all go through.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): But we're not here to debate law, because that's not why-- that's--
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): --too easy.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): It's too easy to debate the law, because then, actually, I'm on their side.
John Donvan (role: mod): Michael Hayden.
Michael Hayden (role: against): That all we have been doing-- all that we have done, has been designed against that opposing armed enemy force-- Al-Qaeda and its affiliates.
Michael Hayden (role: against): All along, despite whatever the rhetoric may have been, we used-- again-- the tools of our own conflict against a specific set of enemies, authorized by the Congress of the United States.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that charge-- it does reflect a mindset, a commitment to discussion over resources, a discussion over sacrifice, that talking about a war is a great deal more than the narrow legal sense that you're talking about.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): I mean, you need something you actually can decide on.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): We didn't come to work with an identical mindset.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): I think it had a different meaning to me then as a civilian in the White House.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): One of the things about this war-- which is different from, certainly, World War II or Vietnam-- is that the national security apparatus-- and actually a subset of it, feels like it's at war.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): But the people don't.
Richard Falkenrath (role: against): So, it hasn't usually been that way for us.
John Donvan (role: mod): So he's saying your definition of war is too subjective.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): Yeah.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): I mean, that was the language of an administration that determined that after 9/11, we would conceive of it at as war.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): And all the-- so, it wasn't just a feeling.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): So let me just give you an example, because that may help-- what this legal debate means.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): So, that's what it is.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): What do we mean by military commissions?
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): Then, we create a whole new military commission system that, under the previous administration, got essentially overturned by the Supreme Court.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): And then you have to say, “What are we going to do with these detainees?” Because it's a problem.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): And then you come back, and you work with Congress, and you create a military commission-- which this president did-- which provides very strong protections for the people within the military commission system, has independent appellate review-- and let's just be clear, has been supported by every Article III court, every federal court in the United States.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): We're just not there.
Juliette Kayyem (role: for): It was the language of the AUMF-- authorization for the use of military force against Al-Qaeda and its affiliates.

John Donvan (role: mod): And round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you in our live audience here in Philadelphia.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing for and against this motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing for the motion, arcing that the president does have this Constitutional power, Alan Dershowitz and Michael Lewis.
John Donvan (role: mod): We've heard them argue that this power actually grows out of the president's war-making abilities and that it was sanctioned by Congress.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say it is up to the president to decide how war is to be fought, and they argue that the battle goes where the combatants go, that that's what defines the location of the battlefield and that there is no distinction to be made between combatants who are our enemies, who are Americans, and combatants who are not Americans; that anybody who signs up for the other side more or less gives away many of the protections of American citizenship.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Hina Shamsi and Noah Feldman, argue that, first of all, the rules matter, that the question of where the battlefield is, a hot battlefield, is essential to this the idea of whether it's right for killing to take place, also where and when that due process is owed to American citizens no matter where they are.
John Donvan (role: mod): They also argue that a trial before getting a death sentence is in essence of liberty, that that's part of who we are and has been for a very long time.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say for the president to have this secret power to act as judge, jury and executioner is a killing power that has no limits.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's-- let's go through-- actually, what I think we need to do is go through some of the discussions and the disagreements we see about definitions and the rules.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to go to the side that's arguing that the president does have this Constitutional power and point out that your opponents have made the argument that your-- your argument that the war goes where the combatants go is false because it's without end and that in fact it's pretty well-established in international law what we mean when we define a battlefield.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say, you're wrong, that a guy sitting in a house in Yemen having coffee is not in the middle of a hot battle, and therefore is not a legitimate target.
John Donvan (role: mod): Alan Dershowitz or Michael Lewis?
John Donvan (role: mod): Alan Dershowitz.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): Well, in the old days, they used to actually have battlefields that were marked off.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): And the battles would occur on the battlefield.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): Obviously, over time, the concept of battlefield is expanded.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): Al-Qaeda expanded it even more by declaring that the battlefield was anywhere where they can legitimately operate from and kill Americans.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): There's no doubt that the battlefield includes Yemen.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): It includes the Sudan.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): It includes parts of Pakistan.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): Of course, it doesn't include Heathrow Airport because we can arrest people at Heathrow Airport.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): For purposes, functionally, of defining the powers as we discuss it, it includes anywhere where al- Qaeda is operating functionally, where it has the protection of local people, where they can't be arrested, and from where they can attack the United States.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): That is a reasonable, functional definition of battlefield, and we have to adapt the definition to our enemies, otherwise our enemies will defeat us through law fare, not through warfare.
John Donvan (role: mod): Hina Shamsi.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): I'm reminded of something that Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said, which is that you're entitled to your own opinions, but you're not entitled to your own facts.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): Here in this situation, you're not really entitled to your own reinterpretations of the law and presenting it as the law currently is.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): Actually, the law is pretty clear.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): There are tests under international law about what a battlefield constitutes.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): It's called hostilities, and it is exactly what it sounds like, which you-- you've got to have a certain threshold of violence.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): You've got to have a certain threshold of repeated violence.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): That standard is quite simply not met by the one that our opponents offer up.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): They would have the battle field be wherever the government says that it is.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): And it's not where the government says it is.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): It isn't where al-Qaeda says it is.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): It is where there actually are the kinds of hostilities happening on the ground.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): But you know, one thing I really want to pick up on and address back and ask our opponents, if I may, and that is-- well, one of the challenges is, professor Dershowitz was citing so many straw men, it's hard to know which one to take up with him.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): But I think one of the ones that I want to lay to rest is the idea that there is somehow a substantive difference in terms of the legal standards when we're talking about citizens and noncitizens.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): It isn't.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): The same legal standards apply to both.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): The difference is that there is no question that citizens are able to have their cases reviewed and to see if there was a Fifth Amendment due process violation.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): Unfortunately, since 9/11, the courts have reduced that possibility for noncitizens.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): But my question for you is, why do you think that it is impossible to have judicial review, at least after the fact when the Supreme Court of that other democracy that carries out targeted killing as state policy, Israel, has actually examined and made a determination about when and whether targeted killings are lawful, set out the standards that must be followed, and established a process for independent review, including judicial review.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's take Michael Lewis.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): Why should the U.S. be different?
John Donvan (role: mod): Michael Lewis.
Michael Lewis (role: for): Expost, after the strike.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): That's right.
Michael Lewis (role: for): The motion that we are having argued is, does the president have the power to order the strike in the first place without prejudicial review.
Michael Lewis (role: for): After the review, that's a different matter.
Michael Lewis (role: for): You're right, Israel has that.
Michael Lewis (role: for): We do have post-strike evaluation within the executive branch.
Michael Lewis (role: for): If we want to expand that to the judicial branch, I would be in favor of that, but that doesn't change the fact that the motion should carry.
Michael Lewis (role: for): The other thing that I want to say about your discussion of the boundaries of the battlefield, or what constitutes a battlefield, the threshold of violence discussion that she mentions is from the Tadicopinion from the ICTY (International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia).
Michael Lewis (role: for): And that applies to internal armed conflicts, right?
Michael Lewis (role: for): This is not dealing with a conflict between a nonstate actor that crosses international boundaries.
Michael Lewis (role: for): That was from the Yugoslav war, right?
Michael Lewis (role: for): If we are talking about the boundaries of battlefields between two nations, World War II did span the entire globe.
Michael Lewis (role: for): Americans killed Japanese and Germans in the south Atlantic and in China and in Burma and off Australia.
Michael Lewis (role: for): All over the world, those things were going on.
Michael Lewis (role: for): And more importantly, if we're talking about what other nations do, other nations facing nonstate actors do not allow them to have a sanctuary, which is what they are saying they should get, by going across international boundary.
Michael Lewis (role: for): You get to Yemen, you get to Somalia, you get to Sudan, and you're safe.
Michael Lewis (role: for): You are immune from attack just because you got to a certain place, and then you can rearm, refit and reattack.
Michael Lewis (role: for): The laws of war do not work that way.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 20.0, 'undecided_for': 14.0, 'for_against': 9.0, 'for_for': 21.0, 'undecided_against': 7.0, 'for_undecided': 0.0, 'undecided_undecided': 5.0, 'against_undecided': 2.0, 'against_against': 23.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 7.0, 'for': 54.0, 'against': 39.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 27.0, 'for': 29.0, 'against': 44.0}}",John Donvan,mod,Noah Feldman.

John Donvan (role: mod): Alan Dershowitz.
John Donvan (role: mod): Alan Dershowitz or Michael Lewis?
John Donvan (role: mod): They say, you're wrong, that a guy sitting in a house in Yemen having coffee is not in the middle of a hot battle, and therefore is not a legitimate target.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to go to the side that's arguing that the president does have this Constitutional power and point out that your opponents have made the argument that your-- your argument that the war goes where the combatants go is false because it's without end and that in fact it's pretty well-established in international law what we mean when we define a battlefield.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's-- let's go through-- actually, what I think we need to do is go through some of the discussions and the disagreements we see about definitions and the rules.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say for the president to have this secret power to act as judge, jury and executioner is a killing power that has no limits.
John Donvan (role: mod): They also argue that a trial before getting a death sentence is in essence of liberty, that that's part of who we are and has been for a very long time.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Hina Shamsi and Noah Feldman, argue that, first of all, the rules matter, that the question of where the battlefield is, a hot battlefield, is essential to this the idea of whether it's right for killing to take place, also where and when that due process is owed to American citizens no matter where they are.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say it is up to the president to decide how war is to be fought, and they argue that the battle goes where the combatants go, that that's what defines the location of the battlefield and that there is no distinction to be made between combatants who are our enemies, who are Americans, and combatants who are not Americans; that anybody who signs up for the other side more or less gives away many of the protections of American citizenship.
John Donvan (role: mod): We've heard them argue that this power actually grows out of the president's war-making abilities and that it was sanctioned by Congress.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing for the motion, arcing that the president does have this Constitutional power, Alan Dershowitz and Michael Lewis.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing for and against this motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): And round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you in our live audience here in Philadelphia.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now onto round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): I'm back.
John Donvan (role: mod): I will be right back.
John Donvan (role: mod): I have dropped my notes.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where the motion is: The president has Constitutional power to target and kill U.S. citizens abroad.
John Donvan (role: mod): Noah Feldman.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you.
Noah Feldman (role: against): I just want to clearly refute the point that somehow the battlefield is anywhere where we can't arrest somebody.
Noah Feldman (role: against): And if you want proof of that, it's that those governments actually agreed to our drone strikes.
Noah Feldman (role: against): You know why?
Noah Feldman (role: against): So we get permission, and we got permission in all of these cases.
Noah Feldman (role: against): And, in principle, arrests would be possible.
Noah Feldman (role: against): If you think that anywhere in the world counts as the battlefield, then even though our motion talks about abroad, if you vote, ""Yes,"" on this motion, ""Yes, the president can do this abroad,"" it follows logically that the president could do it within the United States.
John Donvan (role: mod): Alan Dershowitz, is that-- does that frighten you, that thought?
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): I--what frightens me is the idea that a law professor would be telling the president that it's possible to arrest known terrorists--
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): Well, the president already-- I mean, the executive already has that power as I proved in my opening--
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): If we had a situation where al-Qaeda established a base in the Smoky Mountains from which they were sending rockets to Philadelphia and we couldn't arrest them because they-- the geographical situation was difficult and it would require the sacrifice of 10 or 20 or 30 American soldiers to arrest them, the answer to the question would be, ""Yes.” We could use a sniper, as we have in the past.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): We could use any modern technology to kill an American citizen who was endangering American citizens imminently by having a base firing rockets.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): The criteria would be different, but the power already exists.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): And, Noah, how would you respond to ""What is the difference between a terrorist holding hostages in the United States and the only alternative is to let him continue to hold the hostage, you can't arrest him, but you could kill him by a sniper or a drone, would you deny the executive the power to do that?
Hina Shamsi (role: against): So the answer to that is that no one questions seriously that the police forces, military have the ability to use lethal force in response to an imminent threat.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): And that authority is very distinct from what we've been talking about.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): That's really at the heart of what this debate is.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): We can see if you agree with that or not.

John Donvan (role: mod): Does that-- is that troubling or not, that the courts have no role to play, because your partner was saying that it's kind of ridiculous, the idea that a judge who doesn't know very much about war would be brought into this process?
Michael Lewis (role: for): And we are not here defending the white paper, right?
Michael Lewis (role: for): The government's stance on the white paper and the discussion of imminence is not necessarily the standard that we are asked to meet today.
Michael Lewis (role: for): You are allowed to kill an enemy during wartime whether they are armed, whether they are awake, right?

John Donvan (role: mod): And Michael Lewis, you-- you're-- in fact your opponents, in making that point earlier, also said that's a very big mistake to go into the whole notion of ""trust us.” You know, give the executive a ""trust us"" pass, and that that's-- history shows we don't want to do that.
Michael Lewis (role: for): But I don't think-- well, first of all, when you talk about-- it's not the executive that is saying we are at war.
Michael Lewis (role: for): And al-Qaeda and associated forces, who are they?
Michael Lewis (role: for): In the operational sense, then you're talking about al-Qaeda, al-Qaeda--
Michael Lewis (role: for): So they are saying that if we are going to-- we cannot distribute in detail how we are determining who the enemy is because if we describe in detail who the enemy is, then they will make sure that they are not that, right?
Michael Lewis (role: for): Same thing here.
John Donvan (role: mod): But does that mean they're right, that it is a ""trust us"" situation?
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): But also, every single act of targeted assassination is then reported to the House and Senate intelligence committee.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): And by the way, I'm not opposed to after the fact judicial review.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): There is no inconsistency between saying the president has the power, which is our proposition, and them saying, but if he violates that power or abuses it, you can take him to court under judicial review.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): What we oppose is having the judiciary or the Senate or House, that would be a bill of attainder, but the judiciary in advance saying, well, maybe this guy you can kill, this guy you can't kill, when the president and the intelligence community have information that they cannot disclose.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): About 600 Americans are killed every year by police in the course of arresting fleeing felons.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): The Supreme Court in the case of Gardner vs. Tennessee has said if there is any possibility that the person is dangerous and might commit a crime in the future, if the alternative is to let him escape or not let him escape, you can shoot him dead.
John Donvan (role: mod): Noah Feldman.

Hina Shamsi (role: against): So now we're talking about associated forces.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): The government refuses to define them.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): Part of the core of what we look to in a democracy is when we go to war, we need to know where we're at war at.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): And the kinds of thresholds for war to exist, the kinds of powers that the president can claim in war time to exist, simply are not there.
John Donvan (role: mod): And it sounds as though you're being accused of doing that.
Michael Lewis (role: for): It is Congress that is saying we are at war, and it's their job so say so.
John Donvan (role: mod): But in the operational sense, in the executive sense.
John Donvan (role: mod): I'm talking about the White House is saying, ""Trust us,"" in the operational sense.
Michael Lewis (role: for): If you think about Rico laws, Rico laws are developed to deal with the mafia because the individuals in the mafia knew what they could say or not say, and therefore not be guilty or not be close enough to the crime.

Hina Shamsi<against>: Director of the ACLU National Security Project","Hina Shamsi (role: against): Why should the U.S. be different?
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's take Michael Lewis.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): But my question for you is, why do you think that it is impossible to have judicial review, at least after the fact when the Supreme Court of that other democracy that carries out targeted killing as state policy, Israel, has actually examined and made a determination about when and whether targeted killings are lawful, set out the standards that must be followed, and established a process for independent review, including judicial review.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): Unfortunately, since 9/11, the courts have reduced that possibility for noncitizens.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): The difference is that there is no question that citizens are able to have their cases reviewed and to see if there was a Fifth Amendment due process violation.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): The same legal standards apply to both.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): It isn't.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): But I think one of the ones that I want to lay to rest is the idea that there is somehow a substantive difference in terms of the legal standards when we're talking about citizens and noncitizens.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): But you know, one thing I really want to pick up on and address back and ask our opponents, if I may, and that is-- well, one of the challenges is, professor Dershowitz was citing so many straw men, it's hard to know which one to take up with him.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): It is where there actually are the kinds of hostilities happening on the ground.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): It isn't where al-Qaeda says it is.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): And it's not where the government says it is.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): They would have the battle field be wherever the government says that it is.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): That standard is quite simply not met by the one that our opponents offer up.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): You've got to have a certain threshold of repeated violence.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): It's called hostilities, and it is exactly what it sounds like, which you-- you've got to have a certain threshold of violence.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): There are tests under international law about what a battlefield constitutes.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): Actually, the law is pretty clear.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): Here in this situation, you're not really entitled to your own reinterpretations of the law and presenting it as the law currently is.
Hina Shamsi (role: against): I'm reminded of something that Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said, which is that you're entitled to your own opinions, but you're not entitled to your own facts.
John Donvan (role: mod): Hina Shamsi.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): That is a reasonable, functional definition of battlefield, and we have to adapt the definition to our enemies, otherwise our enemies will defeat us through law fare, not through warfare.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): For purposes, functionally, of defining the powers as we discuss it, it includes anywhere where al- Qaeda is operating functionally, where it has the protection of local people, where they can't be arrested, and from where they can attack the United States.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): Of course, it doesn't include Heathrow Airport because we can arrest people at Heathrow Airport.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): It includes parts of Pakistan.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): It includes the Sudan.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): There's no doubt that the battlefield includes Yemen.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): Al-Qaeda expanded it even more by declaring that the battlefield was anywhere where they can legitimately operate from and kill Americans.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): Obviously, over time, the concept of battlefield is expanded.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): And the battles would occur on the battlefield.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): Well, in the old days, they used to actually have battlefields that were marked off.
John Donvan (role: mod): Alan Dershowitz.
John Donvan (role: mod): Alan Dershowitz or Michael Lewis?
John Donvan (role: mod): They say, you're wrong, that a guy sitting in a house in Yemen having coffee is not in the middle of a hot battle, and therefore is not a legitimate target.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to go to the side that's arguing that the president does have this Constitutional power and point out that your opponents have made the argument that your-- your argument that the war goes where the combatants go is false because it's without end and that in fact it's pretty well-established in international law what we mean when we define a battlefield.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's-- let's go through-- actually, what I think we need to do is go through some of the discussions and the disagreements we see about definitions and the rules.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say for the president to have this secret power to act as judge, jury and executioner is a killing power that has no limits.
John Donvan (role: mod): They also argue that a trial before getting a death sentence is in essence of liberty, that that's part of who we are and has been for a very long time.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Hina Shamsi and Noah Feldman, argue that, first of all, the rules matter, that the question of where the battlefield is, a hot battlefield, is essential to this the idea of whether it's right for killing to take place, also where and when that due process is owed to American citizens no matter where they are.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say it is up to the president to decide how war is to be fought, and they argue that the battle goes where the combatants go, that that's what defines the location of the battlefield and that there is no distinction to be made between combatants who are our enemies, who are Americans, and combatants who are not Americans; that anybody who signs up for the other side more or less gives away many of the protections of American citizenship.
John Donvan (role: mod): We've heard them argue that this power actually grows out of the president's war-making abilities and that it was sanctioned by Congress.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing for the motion, arcing that the president does have this Constitutional power, Alan Dershowitz and Michael Lewis.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing for and against this motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): And round two is where the debaters address one another directly and take questions from me and from you in our live audience here in Philadelphia.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now onto round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): I'm back.
John Donvan (role: mod): I will be right back.
John Donvan (role: mod): I have dropped my notes.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where the motion is: The president has Constitutional power to target and kill U.S. citizens abroad.
John Donvan (role: mod): Noah Feldman.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you.
Noah Feldman (role: against): I just want to clearly refute the point that somehow the battlefield is anywhere where we can't arrest somebody.
Noah Feldman (role: against): And if you want proof of that, it's that those governments actually agreed to our drone strikes.
Noah Feldman (role: against): You know why?
Noah Feldman (role: against): So we get permission, and we got permission in all of these cases.
Noah Feldman (role: against): And, in principle, arrests would be possible.
Noah Feldman (role: against): If you think that anywhere in the world counts as the battlefield, then even though our motion talks about abroad, if you vote, ""Yes,"" on this motion, ""Yes, the president can do this abroad,"" it follows logically that the president could do it within the United States.
John Donvan (role: mod): Alan Dershowitz, is that-- does that frighten you, that thought?
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): I--what frightens me is the idea that a law professor would be telling the president that it's possible to arrest known terrorists--
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): Well, the president already-- I mean, the executive already has that power as I proved in my opening--
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): If we had a situation where al-Qaeda established a base in the Smoky Mountains from which they were sending rockets to Philadelphia and we couldn't arrest them because they-- the geographical situation was difficult and it would require the sacrifice of 10 or 20 or 30 American soldiers to arrest them, the answer to the question would be, ""Yes.” We could use a sniper, as we have in the past.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): We could use any modern technology to kill an American citizen who was endangering American citizens imminently by having a base firing rockets.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): The criteria would be different, but the power already exists.
Alan Dershowitz (role: for): And, Noah, how would you respond to ""What is the difference between a terrorist holding hostages in the United States and the only alternative is to let him continue to hold the hostage, you can't arrest him, but you could kill him by a sniper or a drone, would you deny the executive the power to do that?","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 20.0, 'undecided_for': 14.0, 'for_against': 9.0, 'for_for': 21.0, 'undecided_against': 7.0, 'for_undecided': 0.0, 'undecided_undecided': 5.0, 'against_undecided': 2.0, 'against_against': 23.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 7.0, 'for': 54.0, 'against': 39.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 27.0, 'for': 29.0, 'against': 44.0}}",Hina Shamsi,against,"So the answer to that is that no one questions seriously that the police forces, military have the ability to use lethal force in response to an imminent threat."

John Donvan (role: mod): I know you're not advocating, I just want to see-- Max Boot.
Max Boot (role: against): It says the Taliban, once an isolated and impoverished group of religious students who knew little about the rest of the world and cared only about liberating their country from oppressive warlords are now among the best armed and most experienced insurgents in the world linked to a global movement of jihadists that stretches from Pakistan and Iraq to Chechnya and the Philippines.
Max Boot (role: against): I don't know if you might be related to the gentleman sitting on the other side of the stage here.
Nir Rosen (role: for): When you visit villages, as most journalists who have met Taliban will say, they are local fighters.
Nir Rosen (role: for): They're not fighting more money, by the way.
Nir Rosen (role: for): And you don't really see many Arabs among them.
Nir Rosen (role: for): But sure, they do use suicide bombers.
Nir Rosen (role: for): This is an insurgency tactic.
John Donvan (role: mod): Matthew, I want to acknowledge that I know that you're not saying-- your position is not that we should cut and run.
John Donvan (role: mod): If we left, Peter Bergen and Max Boot, would that be harmful to American interests?
Peter Bergen (role: against): It would be a moral catastrophe to allow the Taliban to take over and impose a regime on Afghans.
Peter Bergen (role: against): We have a moral responsibility to more or less--
Peter Bergen (role: against): --more or less get it right.
Peter Bergen (role: against): The Taliban, by the way, have had ten years to say 9/11 was a bad idea, al-Qaeda is a bad idea.
Peter Bergen (role: against): They've never said that.
Peter Bergen (role: against): They've never done that.
Nir Rosen (role: for): Pakistani Taliban, though.
Peter Bergen (role: against): It's the Taliban.
Peter Bergen (role: against): And if we got out of Afghanistan, they would all come back to Afghanistan.
Peter Bergen (role: against): And what we're trying to prevent is a safe haven in Afghanistan coming back for al-Qaeda and the Taliban who just moved across the border.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's hear Matthew Hoh's response.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): I'd like them to go back into safe haven.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): They do not operate in any manner that we're going to-- they don't operate in a manner that we can attack with conventional forces.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): I urge you to go to the Heritage Foundation website, the Heritage Foundation, not a limp-wristed, left-leaning organization by any means.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): And you'll see it's all done by individuals in small cells who don't require large safe havens.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): And actually the RAND corporation did a study two years ago.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): So the smart way to go about them is to attack al-Qaeda as they actually exist and not as we want them to be or not how they were 10 years ago.

John Donvan (role: mod): I just want to remind people of your background in Afghanistan.
John Donvan (role: mod): You had served in Iraq.
John Donvan (role: mod): This one, you walked away from.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): The main thing is our troops aren't fighting al-Qaeda.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): They're fighting people who are upset that we're occupying their villages and valleys.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): I actually support Peter and Max's polls.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): 32 percent are violently opposed to the point they'll take up rifles.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): It's a regionalized, localized society with many, many different ethnic schisms, regional schisms.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): And remember, this war goes back to the '70s.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): So we-- in 2001, when we intervened, the country was at civil war.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): Now, getting back to the polling data, again, I support that.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): I'll also say that some of the things-- you've got to look at the polling data real well because, yes, 7 percent of the population supports the Taliban.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): Here is the deal, if you are given a choice, if you are a rural Pashtun villager, and you are given a choice between the Taliban who are ethnically and culturally similar to you or the Karzai government which is made of up non-rural Pashtuns, outsiders who are corrupt and who are backed up by an invading and occupying army, which are you going to choose?
Matthew Hoh (role: for): It's a bad choice.
Max Boot (role: against): Can I just-- can I take issue with a point that Matt has made several times now, which is to suggest that the Taliban are fighting essentially because we're there.
Max Boot (role: against): And the fact is the Taliban movement began in the mid 1990s, when there was not a single American soldier in all of Afghanistan.
Max Boot (role: against): And they managed to take over the country after a brutal and horrifying civil war and to impose one of the most totalitarian and anti-Diluvian roles the world has ever seen in Afghanistan.
John Donvan (role: mod): Nir Rosen, is that what you're saying?
Nir Rosen (role: for): That's true.
Nir Rosen (role: for): This is not the Taliban of pre-2001.
Nir Rosen (role: for): They are local people, local farmers who are fighting for very local reasons.
Nir Rosen (role: for): But they are locals fighting for Afghanistan.
Peter Bergen (role: against): I love the fact that this is not the Taliban of 2001.
Peter Bergen (role: against): This is a Taliban that is more ideologically with al-Qaeda.
Peter Bergen (role: against): Suicide attacks went up five times between 2005 and 2006, IED attacks.
Peter Bergen (role: against): There was a public stoning by the Taliban just a few weeks ago.
Peter Bergen (role: against): The whole notion of a moderate Taliban is sort of an oxymoron.
Peter Bergen (role: against): These are unreformed, and they got worse over time.
Peter Bergen (role: against): We're not suggesting that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Nir Rosen and Matthew Hoh.
John Donvan (role: mod): If Afghanistan is lost, if the Taliban takes over significant parts of Afghanistan or simply the chaos continues in Afghanistan is that a threat to American national security?
Nir Rosen (role: for): Al-Qaeda is not in Afghanistan.
Nir Rosen (role: for): They're in Pakistan.
Nir Rosen (role: for): They're in internet cafes and slums around the world.
Nir Rosen (role: for): Al-Qaeda which is based now in Pakistan, to the extent that it exists as a real organization is led by Arabs and Pakistanis.

Peter Bergen<against>: CNN National Security Analyst, Bestselling Author","John Donvan (role: mod): Let's go to Max Boot, and
Max Boot (role: against): That really flies in the face of history.
Max Boot (role: against): They were a response to the chaos to the conditions that prevailed in Afghanistan when we had no presence at all there.
Max Boot (role: against): So the notion that somehow the Taliban would go away or would stop fighting or would suddenly be transformed into Mother Teresa if we weren't there is really ahistorical because if we weren't there, they would take over as they did last time in the 1990s.
Nir Rosen (role: for): Well, they'll probably take over much of the country.
Max Boot (role: against): We rest our case.
Nir Rosen (role: for): This is an insurgent movement which is very clear about its goals.
Nir Rosen (role: for): Maybe it's anti-occupation, maybe it's for Islam or for their village or for revenge or because Americans are backing one tribe against another tribe.
Nir Rosen (role: for): They've always been very clear about that.
Peter Bergen (role: against): This is a much worse Taliban.
Peter Bergen (role: against): The reason that we're facing the big insurgency that we are is that they've adopted wholesale al-Qaeda's tactics from the Iraqi theater.
Peter Bergen (role: against): These groups are much more closely aligned.
Peter Bergen (role: against): And so the idea that somehow the moderate Taliban are going to kind of take-- come into Afghanistan is nonsensical.
Peter Bergen (role: against): Is that the Taliban who let their girls go to school once a month or once a week?
Matthew Hoh (role: for): I resent the idea that the Taliban or the opponents of the Taliban in Afghanistan are wearing white hats, is not true.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): Neither side are paradigms of women's rights or anything in this conflict.
John Donvan (role: mod): You're arguing that Afghanistan is a lost cause.
Nir Rosen (role: for): The Taliban, with their pickup trucks and AK-47s are no threat to the US.
Nir Rosen (role: for): They were defeated.
Nir Rosen (role: for): They're in Yemen.
Nir Rosen (role: for): The Taliban leadership is composed of Afghans.
Nir Rosen (role: for): In all the Taliban statements, the Afghan Taliban, not the Pakistani Taliban, two very different organizations, the Afghan Taliban speaks very much about their goals in Afghanistan.

Peter Bergen<against>: CNN National Security Analyst, Bestselling Author","Max Boot (role: against): And we do and it comes not only from the polling data, which I would cite as Peter did, to show that only about four percent of the Afghan people actually want to return to the Taliban.
Max Boot (role: against): More than 60 percent support the NATO troop presence.
Max Boot (role: against): But that’s what I also find just by talking to ordinary Afghans.
Max Boot (role: against): The biggest cause of resentment of NATO and U.S. forces is the fact that we have not done a better job of creating law and order.
Max Boot (role: against): That’s what they want.
Max Boot (role: against): They don’t want to see a return to the Taliban.
Max Boot (role: against): They want us to defeat the Taliban.
Max Boot (role: against): They support the nascent democracy in Afghanistan and it’s not just the polls, Nir.
Max Boot (role: against): You also look at the number of insurgents that we’re facing and you’re right.
Max Boot (role: against): The number has gone up in recent years but even at the worst case scenarios, worst case estimates we’re facing perhaps 30,000 insurgents.
Max Boot (role: against): The Russians were facing over 200,000.
Max Boot (role: against): The whole society was up in arms against them.
Max Boot (role: against): The society is not in arms against us.
Max Boot (role: against): It’s a very small percentage of the Pashtun population and if we can do a better job-- a lot of people who are fighting are just doing it because they want a paycheck or they’ve been terrorized by the Taliban.
Max Boot (role: against): If we can do a better job of restoring security which we now have a chance to do with over 140,000 NATO troops there, the people will continue, will support us even more strongly than they already do.
John Donvan (role: mod): Max, are the opinion polls, are they reliable?
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponent, Nir, has made the point that you’re polling in the cities, you’re not polling in the countryside.
Max Boot (role: against): You know, there’s always questions about the reliability of opinion polls not only in Afghanistan but here.
John Donvan (role: mod): that’s a very different--
Max Boot (role: against): But the polls have been pretty consistent over a number of years and they comport with what I and many other people find out for ourselves by talking to ordinary Afghans which is that there is not an overwhelming resentment of foreigners.
Nir Rosen (role: for): I don’t think you talked to ordinary Afghans.
Nir Rosen (role: for): It’s not really like you’ve been in Afghanistan.
Peter Bergen (role: against): Okay, well, criticizing Max--
Peter Bergen (role: against): I mean, let’s get back to the real point.
Peter Bergen (role: against): I’ve been visiting Afghanistan since ’93.
Peter Bergen (role: against): The Afghans destroyed Kabul.
Peter Bergen (role: against): Hundreds of thousands of people died.
Peter Bergen (role: against): They were the most brutal and incompetent regime.
Peter Bergen (role: against): Only seven percent of Afghans have a favorable view.
Peter Bergen (role: against): They’re conducted by major news organizations, the BBC, ABC News, German television, the Asia Foundation.
Peter Bergen (role: against): These are as good as polls that come out in this country.
Peter Bergen (role: against): But in general, you know that the trend is pro American, pro-NATO, anti-Taliban.
John Donvan (role: mod): Matthew, let me put the question to you.
John Donvan (role: mod): You went out there as a foreign service officer.
John Donvan (role: mod): You believed in missions.
John Donvan (role: mod): What was it that-- what was the ultimate turning point for you that you would do something so dramatic that you saw such failure written there that you would turn away from it?
Matthew Hoh (role: for): They're fighting Taliban.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): The U.S. intelligence community will cite-- you can look at the Boston globe from September 2009, that nine out of ten members of the Taliban are members of the Taliban because of foreign occupation and because of an ongoing civil war.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): 60 percent or 68 percent of Afghans are for our presence.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): This-- Afghanistan is not a homogenous society.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): There are Hatfield and McCoy type situations that our troops are finding themselves in the middle every day.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): The reason the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan was because the country was already at war.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): We took one side out of power and put the other side in power, but we didn't address those underlying root causes of the conflict.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): You probably have about a 60/40 split in the country.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): However, in the Asia Foundation poll that was just cited, 80 percent of the population supported talking to the Taliban and negotiating with them.

John Donvan (role: mod): So in a minute or two I'll come to you, and just raise your hands.
John Donvan (role: mod): So let's come back to the debate.
John Donvan (role: mod): I'm John Donvan of ABC News.
John Donvan (role: mod): And something that has come up in the discussion is the fact that our allies, the government of Afghanistan, is not by any definition savory.
Max Boot (role: against): Well, John, the fact is we don't have perfect allies in Afghanistan, but that's true in any counterinsurgency fight because think about it, the reason why you have an insurgency in the first place is because the government isn't doing a very good job.
Max Boot (role: against): Despite that, however, most insurgencies fail.
Max Boot (role: against): That means in more than 65 percent of cases, it has been possible to increase government capacity to not only militarily defeat the insurgency, but also to take away some of the reasons why they're able to recruit in the first place.
Max Boot (role: against): And there is no question that the Afghan government has many imperfections, that it has corruption, it is ineffective, it has a lot of other problems, but, again, on the other side, you are not exactly facing-- you're not exactly facing the League of Women Voters.
Max Boot (role: against): They know the current government has problems.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponent, Nir's, point that you're not getting around Afghanistan the way he is, that you're not seeing the uglier side of it the way that he has, is painting for you a rosier picture, and it's not quite an ad hominem argument, there's actually an issue of data collection there.
Max Boot (role: against): Well, there's no question that Nir has embedded with the Taliban and I haven’t, so hats off to him.
Max Boot (role: against): And, in fact, the reality is most of the Afghans are not part of the Taliban.
Max Boot (role: against): And, again, you don’t have to take my word for it, you don’t have to take the word of the pollsters for it, all you have to do is look at the number of Afghans who have-- as I mentioned before, who have actually taken up arms against the government.
John Donvan (role: mod): And to the side that’s arguing that Afghanistan is a lost cause, something that your opponents said that I found quite interesting is that you have a very high bar to prove.
John Donvan (role: mod): And if it’s in the future, is-- what if we pour in more troops, what if we increase our effort, what if we simply allow more time to go by, in making things try to work?
Nir Rosen (role: for): More is the problem, the more troops we put in there, the more money we’ve put in, we’ve actually created a conflict because of our money.
Nir Rosen (role: for): In Afghanistan the only resource is American money.
Nir Rosen (role: for): It’s all about American money, the more we put in there, the more of our presence, the more supplies it requires, the more warlords we’re paying to protect our convoys.
Nir Rosen (role: for): In Afghanistan we're using Afghan warlords.
Nir Rosen (role: for): The problem--
Peter Bergen (role: against): I think quite the reverse, the less we did, the worse it got.
Peter Bergen (role: against): That’s the size of the police department of Houston in a country the size of Texas with a population 10 times larger.
Peter Bergen (role: against): Into the vacuum of governance and authority stepped the Taliban and al Qaeda and actually this raises a very good point which is it would be much more convincing to say that look, we should just sort of wash our hands of Afghanistan if we hadn’t already done it twice.
Peter Bergen (role: against): The Clinton administration then zeroed out aid to one of the poorest countries in the world and into that vacuum stepped the Taliban and al Qaeda.
Peter Bergen (role: against): So it’s not because we’ve done too much.
Peter Bergen (role: against): We’re finally beginning to-- we’re in year one of a serious effort.

Max Boot (role: against): Now, the author of that article, which ran in “Rolling Stone,” in 2008, called “How We Lost the War We Won,” was a fellow named Nir Rosen.

Peter Bergen (role: against): We overthrew their government.

Peter Bergen (role: against): And in fact as we've seen in Times Square that these groups are very closely aligned.
Nir Rosen (role: for): It's dishonest to compare the Afghan Taliban with the Pakistani Taliban.

Matthew Hoh (role: for): And you'll see that they documented the 30 attacks against the United States by transnational terror groups, primarily by al-Qaeda, for the last ten years.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): Since 2001 al-Qaeda has evolved into an organization that is decentralized, it's near virtual, and it does not exist in a manner that we can attack.

Peter Bergen (role: against): It's the Taliban.
Peter Bergen (role: against): And if we got out of Afghanistan, they would all come back to Afghanistan.
Peter Bergen (role: against): And what we're trying to prevent is a safe haven in Afghanistan coming back for al-Qaeda and the Taliban who just moved across the border.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's hear Matthew Hoh's response.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): I'd like them to go back into safe haven.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): They do not operate in any manner that we're going to-- they don't operate in a manner that we can attack with conventional forces.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): I urge you to go to the Heritage Foundation website, the Heritage Foundation, not a limp-wristed, left-leaning organization by any means.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): And you'll see it's all done by individuals in small cells who don't require large safe havens.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): And actually the RAND corporation did a study two years ago.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): So the smart way to go about them is to attack al-Qaeda as they actually exist and not as we want them to be or not how they were 10 years ago.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): They evolve.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): It does not make any sense why al-Qaeda would want to go to a place or go back into a form where they could be readily attacked by our aircraft, our cruise missiles, our commandos.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right.
John Donvan (role: mod): And when we come back, I want to talk about who our allies are.
John Donvan (role: mod): I'm not asking you for questions.
John Donvan (role: mod): So in a minute or two I'll come to you, and just raise your hands.
John Donvan (role: mod): So let's come back to the debate.
John Donvan (role: mod): I'm John Donvan of ABC News.
John Donvan (role: mod): And something that has come up in the discussion is the fact that our allies, the government of Afghanistan, is not by any definition savory.
Max Boot (role: against): Well, John, the fact is we don't have perfect allies in Afghanistan, but that's true in any counterinsurgency fight because think about it, the reason why you have an insurgency in the first place is because the government isn't doing a very good job.
Max Boot (role: against): Despite that, however, most insurgencies fail.
Max Boot (role: against): That means in more than 65 percent of cases, it has been possible to increase government capacity to not only militarily defeat the insurgency, but also to take away some of the reasons why they're able to recruit in the first place.
Max Boot (role: against): And there is no question that the Afghan government has many imperfections, that it has corruption, it is ineffective, it has a lot of other problems, but, again, on the other side, you are not exactly facing-- you're not exactly facing the League of Women Voters.
Max Boot (role: against): They know the current government has problems.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponent, Nir's, point that you're not getting around Afghanistan the way he is, that you're not seeing the uglier side of it the way that he has, is painting for you a rosier picture, and it's not quite an ad hominem argument, there's actually an issue of data collection there.
Max Boot (role: against): Well, there's no question that Nir has embedded with the Taliban and I haven’t, so hats off to him.
Max Boot (role: against): And, in fact, the reality is most of the Afghans are not part of the Taliban.
Max Boot (role: against): And, again, you don’t have to take my word for it, you don’t have to take the word of the pollsters for it, all you have to do is look at the number of Afghans who have-- as I mentioned before, who have actually taken up arms against the government.
John Donvan (role: mod): And to the side that’s arguing that Afghanistan is a lost cause, something that your opponents said that I found quite interesting is that you have a very high bar to prove.
John Donvan (role: mod): And if it’s in the future, is-- what if we pour in more troops, what if we increase our effort, what if we simply allow more time to go by, in making things try to work?
Nir Rosen (role: for): More is the problem, the more troops we put in there, the more money we’ve put in, we’ve actually created a conflict because of our money.
Nir Rosen (role: for): In Afghanistan the only resource is American money.
Nir Rosen (role: for): It’s all about American money, the more we put in there, the more of our presence, the more supplies it requires, the more warlords we’re paying to protect our convoys.
Nir Rosen (role: for): In Afghanistan we're using Afghan warlords.
Nir Rosen (role: for): The problem--
Peter Bergen (role: against): I think quite the reverse, the less we did, the worse it got.
Peter Bergen (role: against): That’s the size of the police department of Houston in a country the size of Texas with a population 10 times larger.
Peter Bergen (role: against): Into the vacuum of governance and authority stepped the Taliban and al Qaeda and actually this raises a very good point which is it would be much more convincing to say that look, we should just sort of wash our hands of Afghanistan if we hadn’t already done it twice.
Peter Bergen (role: against): The Clinton administration then zeroed out aid to one of the poorest countries in the world and into that vacuum stepped the Taliban and al Qaeda.

Nir Rosen (role: for): Well, they'll probably take over much of the country.
Max Boot (role: against): We rest our case.
Nir Rosen (role: for): This is an insurgent movement which is very clear about its goals.
Nir Rosen (role: for): Maybe it's anti-occupation, maybe it's for Islam or for their village or for revenge or because Americans are backing one tribe against another tribe.
Nir Rosen (role: for): They've always been very clear about that.
Peter Bergen (role: against): This is a much worse Taliban.
Peter Bergen (role: against): The reason that we're facing the big insurgency that we are is that they've adopted wholesale al-Qaeda's tactics from the Iraqi theater.
Peter Bergen (role: against): These groups are much more closely aligned.
Peter Bergen (role: against): And so the idea that somehow the moderate Taliban are going to kind of take-- come into Afghanistan is nonsensical.
Peter Bergen (role: against): Is that the Taliban who let their girls go to school once a month or once a week?

John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponent, Nir, has made the point that you’re polling in the cities, you’re not polling in the countryside.
Max Boot (role: against): You know, there’s always questions about the reliability of opinion polls not only in Afghanistan but here.
John Donvan (role: mod): that’s a very different--
Max Boot (role: against): But the polls have been pretty consistent over a number of years and they comport with what I and many other people find out for ourselves by talking to ordinary Afghans which is that there is not an overwhelming resentment of foreigners.

Nir Rosen (role: for): It’s not really like you’ve been in Afghanistan.

Peter Bergen (role: against): I’ve been visiting Afghanistan since ’93.
Peter Bergen (role: against): The Afghans destroyed Kabul.
Peter Bergen (role: against): Hundreds of thousands of people died.
Peter Bergen (role: against): They were the most brutal and incompetent regime.
Peter Bergen (role: against): Only seven percent of Afghans have a favorable view.
Peter Bergen (role: against): They’re conducted by major news organizations, the BBC, ABC News, German television, the Asia Foundation.
Peter Bergen (role: against): These are as good as polls that come out in this country.
Peter Bergen (role: against): But in general, you know that the trend is pro American, pro-NATO, anti-Taliban.
John Donvan (role: mod): Matthew, let me put the question to you.
John Donvan (role: mod): You went out there as a foreign service officer.
John Donvan (role: mod): You believed in missions.
John Donvan (role: mod): What was it that-- what was the ultimate turning point for you that you would do something so dramatic that you saw such failure written there that you would turn away from it?
Matthew Hoh (role: for): They're fighting Taliban.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): The U.S. intelligence community will cite-- you can look at the Boston globe from September 2009, that nine out of ten members of the Taliban are members of the Taliban because of foreign occupation and because of an ongoing civil war.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): 60 percent or 68 percent of Afghans are for our presence.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): This-- Afghanistan is not a homogenous society.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): There are Hatfield and McCoy type situations that our troops are finding themselves in the middle every day.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): The reason the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan was because the country was already at war.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): We took one side out of power and put the other side in power, but we didn't address those underlying root causes of the conflict.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): You probably have about a 60/40 split in the country.
Matthew Hoh (role: for): However, in the Asia Foundation poll that was just cited, 80 percent of the population supported talking to the Taliban and negotiating with them.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right, let's go--
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's go to Max Boot, and

John Donvan (role: mod): David Burstein.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you.
John Donvan (role: mod): So, Keith, respond to your opponent.
W. Keith Campbell (role: for): I'm not as big a fan.
W. Keith Campbell (role: for): I don't know if we're seeing that.
W. Keith Campbell (role: for): I don't know if there's data on our people saying, look, I'm in trouble-- I'm going to do X, Y and Z to get out of trouble, or are they-- are they kind of moving into something else to get away from it.
John Donvan (role: mod): Jessica?
Jessica Grose (role: against): It was mentioned that millennials are putting off marriage and family, and that, in large part, is because women have flooded into the work force and have higher levels of educational attainment.
Jessica Grose (role: against): They are putting off these things not out of a sense of immaturity but because they do want all of their ducks in a row.
Jessica Grose (role: against): It just-- that planning takes longer.
Jessica Grose (role: against): I mean, all of the studies show that older parents are better parents.
Jessica Grose (role: against): That's a cause for celebration.
John Donvan (role: mod): Binta Brown.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): But keep in mind that not only did your generation go through all of the things your generation has gone through, but the X 'ers and the boomers and many members of the greatest generation have gone through the same.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): I mean, I think our context is we were children of the Cold War.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): We were children who saw the walls come down, sure.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): But I think that you can look at any point in history and say, yes, but we're extra optimistic because of-- look at what we've gone through.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): And I'm sorry to keep doing this to you.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): You say that your generation is more frugal, and in fact, studies shows that your generation has had the fastest increase from luxury consumption.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): But at the same time, they've increased 33 percent in their purchases of premium fashion and services, more than any other generation.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let's let the other side respond to that-- to that argument about materialism.
John Donvan (role: mod): Jessica or David.
David D. Burstein (role: against): Well, I mean, I think the important thing to consider there is what-- as millennial spending patterns change, for instance, as Jessica is mentioning, when people are not planning for these large payments, of course you're going to see increases in other kinds of spending.
David D. Burstein (role: against): I also think one of the interesting things about, you look at one of the-- in those numbers, there are two things which are kind of tricky, which is one is increased spending on people eating out and increased spending on travel.
David D. Burstein (role: against): And this goes to the question of thinking about community, which I think is really one of the big traits of this generation.
John Donvan (role: mod): So can you very quickly, and in 15 seconds, list some of those ways, then I want to hear from your opponent, Keith.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 11.0, 'undecided_for': 16.0, 'for_against': 5.0, 'for_for': 10.0, 'undecided_against': 16.0, 'for_undecided': 0.0, 'undecided_undecided': 9.0, 'against_undecided': 5.0, 'against_against': 29.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 10.0, 'for': 38.0, 'against': 52.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 35.0, 'for': 18.0, 'against': 47.0}}",John Donvan,mod,Quantified how?

W. Keith Campbell (role: for): I'm saying the levels of narcissism have gone up about half a standard deviation which is shifting a little bit.
W. Keith Campbell (role: for): What happens at the extremes is that the extremes go up a lot.
W. Keith Campbell (role: for): What happens, though, is you-- when you shift everybody a little bit, the number of people at the extremes goes up a lot, and those are the ones that want to drive you crazy when you interview them for jobs--

John Donvan (role: mod): You've already said that your generation is the victim of a lot of myths, but, you know, your opponent has studied this, takes it seriously, and definitely bears you no ill will on this.
John Donvan (role: mod): So in any way honestly do you recognize your generation in that description?
Jessica Grose (role: against): I think it's a fundamental misunderstanding of the way we use social media.
Jessica Grose (role: against): We just are the first to have these tools, so, yes, maybe a pretty selfie of yourself might seem to be narcissistic but I think that that's just-- that's the way we move through the world.
Jessica Grose (role: against): But it's really just a fluid thing.
Jessica Grose (role: against): And I just think that it's not actual evidence of anything except these tools existing.

John Donvan (role: mod): But do you need to concede that point?
Jessica Grose (role: against): I mean, I will make the example of G chat.
Jessica Grose (role: against): The constant communication that we can have with our close compatriots is immeasurable.

Jessica Grose (role: against): You know, I think people say it's three people that they consider confidantes.
John Donvan (role: mod): Are you persuaded, Binta, by that?
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): And I use that as a means of bringing myself closer to them.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): But what I dispute is that millennials have a more diverse set of relationships.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): Well, because the studies don't show that.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): Again, going back to that 43 percent nonwhite number, I do not see, on college campuses, close integration between the black and Hispanic populations and the white populations.

Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): Can we just talk about--
David D. Burstein (role: against): And I think that that's really what's particularly striking about it.
David D. Burstein (role: against): But what's even more interesting is that people are optimistic about their situation at the moment, not just about their future and what's ahead.
David D. Burstein (role: against): But if you consider that in terms of context, as I mentioned earlier, I think that's what's really important, that you would expect in the worst job market in history, you would expect in the face of huge unemployment and the terrible economic climate, that the natural-- the natural tendency would be for people to be incredibly not optimistic about their own economic future.
David D. Burstein (role: against): It's actually a little bit higher among millennials than it was among generation X.

Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): But it's not anything special when you compare it to other generations, unfortunately.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): I hope that's not the case for millennials.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): But the practical reality is that, as people grow older, and as their responsibilities increase, and as they do take on mortgages and have families and have additional constraints, the ability to service that optimism in every generation or over the course of history, it decreases, right?
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): David, I hope that you keep your pragmatic idealism, as you've written about.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): And I hope that you keep your optimism.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): We expect the young to be optimistic.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): Optimism is not something that's lost upon the young, right?
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): And I think that when you look at the level of optimism for generation X when we were the very same age as you guys are now, it was actually equal to your level of optimism.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): So I think optimism is awesome.
John Donvan (role: mod): Binta Brown.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to put to either of you a response to that, either Binta or Keith.
John Donvan (role: mod): But, boy, do they believe in themselves, and purely on optimism, they think they're going to get through.
John Donvan (role: mod): To a great degree, concede that times are tough.
John Donvan (role: mod): They've heard everything you said.
John Donvan (role: mod): What I want to do is put a question to the side that is arguing that millennials don't stand a chance, and tell you that what I hear from your opponents is an explosion of optimism.
John Donvan (role: mod): And therefore, that it holds in its hands-- and its personalities-- the solutions to the very challenges that they are facing.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say, in response to the notion that they're narcissistic, that no generation has been as civically involved as this one, that this generation has healthy relationships and entrepreneurial spirit, that it's optimistic, resilient.
John Donvan (role: mod): It's not because they're freeloading, it's because they are frugal, that they are conserving their resources in a difficult time, that they know what they're doing.
John Donvan (role: mod): Yes, perhaps, they live in their basement.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion-- Keith-- Jessica Grose and David Burstein-- they're saying that basically millennials are the victims of a lot of ridiculous myths in the media.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're saying none of this is their fault, that they've been cheated by the generations ahead of them who left them a terrible deal.
John Donvan (role: mod): They're not saying nasty things about their opponents.
John Donvan (role: mod): Bottom line?
John Donvan (role: mod): They can see that there are success stories, but they say those are the exception and that things are particularly bleak for minorities.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say that they have not been as well educated as they think they are, that they are postponing adulthood, that they are narcissistic like no generation has ever been.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing for the motion-- W. Keith Campell and Binta Brown-- we heard them say basically that millennials have been set up to fail by being sent into a challenging world without really having any of the antibodies to challenge.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two arguing for and against the motion.

Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): And some of them actually somewhat worse.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): We were children of gas crises.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): And that set into some of our optimism.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): That argument just doesn't really sit with me, particularly as-- when you think about what Keith is saying with optimism and what are the dangers, and there‘s a rebuttal in part to Jessica.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): But one of the dangers with optimism is that it does fuel consumption.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): I think I saw something along the lines of-- well, 25 percent of millennials report not having enough to cover their expenses.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): let's call it.
John Donvan (role: mod): David, we haven't heard from you in a minute.
David D. Burstein (role: against): That should not be surprising to anyone who looks at economics, that when people are not planning to buy houses and cars and these big capital expenses that people normally go through, that you would see increased spending in other areas.
David D. Burstein (role: against): Both of those things, if you go deeper into studies on both of those issues, show that people are engaging in those activities with friends as a way of developing communal experiences.
David D. Burstein (role: against): This generation is finding new ways to engage community in helping them
David D. Burstein (role: against): Well, I think the most important point I would make on that is that this is a generation that has more relationships, more strong relationships with a diverse set of people than any generation.
John Donvan (role: mod): Is that your gut, or is there--
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
W. Keith Campbell (role: for): Well, I think what we've traded, in a large part because it's the ability to have social networks, Facebook or whatever, is we have broader social networks.
W. Keith Campbell (role: for): I think there's been a tradeoff of depth to some extent because it takes time to nurture a broad network.
W. Keith Campbell (role: for): I just don't think the depth is necessarily deeper.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to-- let me take that question to Jessica, because, Jessica, a couple of times you've done a little flipping of their narrative, as you did with postponing marriage, which I'd like to come back to.
John Donvan (role: mod): And I think a lot of us understand why they say that, why there's a logic to that.
Jessica Grose (role: against): No, absolutely.
Jessica Grose (role: against): I talk to my friends throughout the day on G chat, the same people over and over again, the same set of four women who, if, before the advent of technology, I would have had to call them, walk over to them.
Jessica Grose (role: against): So, yes, we might have geographic distance or, you know, we might have these broader, you know, networks of friends.
Jessica Grose (role: against): And I think, you know, the number of close friends that people have has not demonstrably changed.
Jessica Grose (role: against): And I don't think that those numbers have moved.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): Yeah, I mean, I-- listen, from my perspective, I have a huge number of friends on all various forms of social media.

W. Keith Campbell (role: for): I just don't the answer to that.

Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): Just to talk about this context point, David, so first of all, it stinks to be young, having gone through what your generation has gone through.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): And some of them actually somewhat worse.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): We were children of gas crises.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): And that set into some of our optimism.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): That argument just doesn't really sit with me, particularly as-- when you think about what Keith is saying with optimism and what are the dangers, and there‘s a rebuttal in part to Jessica.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): But one of the dangers with optimism is that it does fuel consumption.
Binta Niambi Brown (role: for): I think I saw something along the lines of-- well, 25 percent of millennials report not having enough to cover their expenses.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
John Donvan (role: mod): let's call it.
John Donvan (role: mod): David, we haven't heard from you in a minute.
David D. Burstein (role: against): That should not be surprising to anyone who looks at economics, that when people are not planning to buy houses and cars and these big capital expenses that people normally go through, that you would see increased spending in other areas.
David D. Burstein (role: against): Both of those things, if you go deeper into studies on both of those issues, show that people are engaging in those activities with friends as a way of developing communal experiences.
David D. Burstein (role: against): This generation is finding new ways to engage community in helping them
David D. Burstein (role: against): Well, I think the most important point I would make on that is that this is a generation that has more relationships, more strong relationships with a diverse set of people than any generation.
John Donvan (role: mod): Is that your gut, or is there--
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay.
W. Keith Campbell (role: for): Well, I think what we've traded, in a large part because it's the ability to have social networks, Facebook or whatever, is we have broader social networks.
W. Keith Campbell (role: for): I think there's been a tradeoff of depth to some extent because it takes time to nurture a broad network.
W. Keith Campbell (role: for): I just don't think the depth is necessarily deeper.
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to-- let me take that question to Jessica, because, Jessica, a couple of times you've done a little flipping of their narrative, as you did with postponing marriage, which I'd like to come back to.

Dale Murphy (role: against): I think he had a good P.R.
Dale Murphy (role: against): It doesn't make it right.
Radley Balko (role: for): And if a guy can, uh, get back into the game quicker because of HGH, is that any different than a, you know, a construction worker who wants to get back on the job quicker because his pay check is dependent on it, taking something, a drug that has minimal effects that helps him recover quicker?
Bob Costas (role: mod): Um, are we in a pass/fail mindset about the whole array of performance enhancing drugs, especially after the Mitchell Report, if we talk about baseball, where if you're in the Mitchell Report, you're guilty, no matter what you did, you're as guilty as the most full blown juicer.

Bob Costas (role: mod): But it’s naïve to believe that each competitor, many of them obsessed with victory and believing in the full bloom of youth that they’re invulnerable, would stay within those limits, once there were unfettered access, they could just take as much as they wanted to gain whatever short-term competitive advantage they wanted, couldn’t they?
Bob Costas (role: mod): All right, suppose we were to adopt Julian’s suggestion, that there were regulated, permissible regulated use of performance- The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” enhancing drugs, and in each case it was appropriate to the spirit of the particular sport, that’s fine in the ideal.
Norman Fost (role: for): They could get drugs that would be manufactured in an American manufacturing facility with oversight by the FDA, and they’d be getting advice from doctors on which drugs were safe and effe— effective, which now they can’t find out even if they want to because the stuff comes from Mexico.
Norman Fost (role: for): Because if athletes could go to doctors and get drugs without having to go to Mexico or to BALCO Labs, they could A, get drugs which had been studied and tested and approved by the FDA, they’d know what they were taking.
Bob Costas (role: mod): Why.
Norman Fost (role: for): Nobody knows but my guess is it would be exactly the opposite.
Bob Costas (role: mod): Dr. Fost, if there were unfettered access to performance-enhancing drugs, isn’t it The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” reasonable to posit that, even now, or even during the so-called steroid era, there were some constraints, some fear of being, uh, caught, there were some tests, however flawed— But if it’s all wide open, it would go beyond any levels we’ve seen heretofore, and could possibly, get into an area where not only would the competition be grotesque, but where there would be real and verifiable health risks.
Bob Costas (role: mod): Our thanks to George Michael, and again, according to the format I’ll pose a question to each side of the table.

Bob Costas (role: mod): So Julian is holding his left arm at a certain level and his right arm above it.
Julian Savulescu (role: for): But what you will be doing is narrowing the advantage that the cheater has, because now there’s a market for safe performance enhancement.

Bob Costas (role: mod): The Rosenkranz Foundation - Intelligence Squared US Debate “Performance Enhancing Drugs in Competitive Sports” Dick, after all your years with the Olympics and with WADA, are you troubled by the fact that despite best efforts, the penalties are almost by definition disproportionate?
Bob Costas (role: mod): Marion Jones was never caught by Olympic testing, sophisticated as it was.
Bob Costas (role: mod): And the same year that Ben Johnson was caught, others had statistical anomalies in their performances, and for whatever reason, they were not caught.
Richard Pound (role: against): Oh, sure it does, of course it does.
Richard Pound (role: against): It’s one of the reasons why, why in WADA we devote, I think it’s about twenty-five percent of our entire budget to scientific research, so we can, we can find EPO, we can find HGH, we can find, uh, evidence of blood transfusions.
Richard Pound (role: against): We’re getting a screening test that I think will be able to detect the stuff very unobtrusively by the time it comes on.

John Donvan (role: mod): Try not to be ideological.
John Donvan (role: mod): Try to be provocative.
John Donvan (role: mod): So on into round two, and round two, as I said, is where the debaters address each other directly.
John Donvan (role: mod): The motion is ""Obamacare is now beyond rescue.""
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams arguing for and against that.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing for the motion, Scott Gottlieb and Megan McArdle, have argued-- in a sense, they are arguing that the law from its beginnings has always been beyond rescue, that it reduces competition, it reduces choice, it pushes people into Medicaid, a system which does not have good medical outcomes, or at least not the kind of medical outcomes that people would aspire to for it.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they've described the law as a Rube Goldberg kind of apparatus and that the administration only gets away with calling it ""successful"" in any way by continuously moving the goalposts.
John Donvan (role: mod): Team arguing against the motion, Dr. Douglas Kamerow and Jonathan Chait, say, ""Yeah, the law is not perfect,"" but they're arguing that it's working in real ways already, that there are more people insured now than there were three years ago in the United States, that standards are being forced, and that-- in general, that we've come a long way.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they also argue that the terms of the basic law, the aspirations of the law, that lots of countries do it, and that, in fact, it does work.
John Donvan (role: mod): They argue that the opposition from their opponents is more ideological, that they just don't actually want the law to succeed, a question I'd actually like to put to the side arguing for the motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): Is that the case?
John Donvan (role: mod): Would you-- in an ideal world, would Obamacare succeed or would you hate that?
John Donvan (role: mod): Scott Gottlieb.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): Well, look, I-- look, in a wealthy country, I think we need to address issues of people who are priced out of the market, people who have preexisting conditions and can't find coverage.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): I think there were far more efficient ways to do that.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): You could've given people incentives to get insured and stay insured, and it would have required that you subsidize certain people to get into the marketplace and subsidize them through transitions in life where they might otherwise not have the income and lose coverage.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): There's nothing inherently wrong with pooling people based on what state they live in, for example, if that's the point, if this is copying Mitt Romney's plan.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): What's inherently wrong with this law is the way that the law tries to prescribe a uniform federal standard for what needs to be in everyone's insurance policy.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): And so these decisions get made in a political context, and you end up with policies that are exceedingly expensive, laden down with mandates that don't meet what consumers want.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): And then you tell insurers they can't underwrite risk, they can't use cost sharing as a tool to steer people to certain benefits or others, they can't change the benefit design, and so they're forced to do one thing which is to narrow the networks of providers that people have access to and to skinny down the drug formularies, which is exactly what we've done in Medicaid.
John Donvan (role: mod): Scott, to the point of the motion and granting all of that, are you saying that, therefore, the law cannot work, that it's doomed to collapse in on itself--
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): It’s the structure that's inherently flawed.
Dr. Douglas Kamerow (role: against): Scott, can I ask a question?
Dr. Douglas Kamerow (role: against): Scott, you're saying-- you're describing what you would have liked, but let's be real-- let's be realistic: if the choice is we have Obamacare now, it's a law, what are the chances of any kind of scenario that you're describing taking-- taking flight, passing both houses of Congress at any time in the foreseeable future?
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): I think that the problem is that the people in Washington-- progressives in Washington can't resist the temptation to tinker with every aspect of what the provisions are, and you end up with regulations that prescribe exactly what people have to have and don't have to have.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): Surgical sterilization is in.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): Certain things are out.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): You have a law that gets laden down with mandates and it ends up being-- exceeding expensive to provide this coverage to everyone, they have to do it, the insurers have to go after the network, exactly what we've done in Medicaid.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): We've promised a very rich set of benefits on paper in Medicaid.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): It looks like a fabulous program, but we know Medicaid recipients can't get access to the care.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): I don't think it's being done politically because it-- these decisions now are being made in Washington.
John Donvan (role: mod): Jonathan Chait, do you want to respond?
Jonathan Chait (role: against): Megan, answer the question
John Donvan (role: mod): Yeah, Megan?
Megan McArdle (role: for): Oh, well, I would say that I certainly agree with Jonathan Chait, that this is going much, much, much worse than I thought, and there are all sorts of problems that I didn't anticipate.
Megan McArdle (role: for): So to that extent, it's true.
Megan McArdle (role: for): I'm picking on stuff that I did not predict because my worries at the time of passage were about things like the federal budget deficit and would the cost controls hold.
Megan McArdle (role: for): Will this tamp down innovation, which is, if you think about the millions of unborn or still living but not yet sick people who can be cured by innovations that haven't happened yet, I was worried about that.
Megan McArdle (role: for): But we haven't gotten to the point where I can worry about those sorts of things.

Dr. Douglas Kamerow (role: against): What's the plan then?
Megan McArdle (role: for): But I will say that Mr. Chait says that I’m against national health care and which is actually not true.
Megan McArdle (role: for): It’s something that preserves the market mechanism.
Megan McArdle (role: for): Everyone is-- you know, you're taking care poor, but otherwise it's progressive.
Megan McArdle (role: for): I think that is actually the kind of system that you could grow out of Obamacare if it failed.
Jonathan Chait (role: against): The reason I wrote that you're against national health care is because in 2009 you wrote a column called ""Why I Oppose National Health Care.""
Jonathan Chait (role: against): So if you're talking about moving the goal post your definition of failure just keeps getting smaller and smaller.
Megan McArdle (role: for): I've been proposing it for a fairly long time.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): Every year-- this is a provision that a lot of people haven't noticed yet.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): In Medicare Part D they also get re- priced.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): They get re-priced each year from a blended average of all the plans in the marketplace.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): In this marketplace they get re-priced off the second cheapest plan in every market.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): Next year all the policies in Florida will now be re-priced off that plan.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): That is a death spiral.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): It's a death spiral in the quality of the coverage.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): Now again, I haven't heard anyone defend Medicaid.
John Donvan (role: mod): Doug Kamerow.
John Donvan (role: mod): Just as the point is out there right now, the reason I bring it up is that in his opening statements Scott emphasized that essentially Obamacare is really a Medicaid plan and the problem with that is he talked about the outcomes for Medicaid are not satisfactory, but I think it's a valid point for him to have put out there.
Dr. Douglas Kamerow (role: against): It doesn't just change the coverage.
Dr. Douglas Kamerow (role: against): As you know, as a practicing doctor, where you practice a lot of places don't take Medicaid and they don't take it because the rates are laughable.
Dr. Douglas Kamerow (role: against): It's not because, I don’t think, because the patients have certain problems that they're not willing to deal with, seems unlikely.
Dr. Douglas Kamerow (role: against): One of the things it does, at least temporarily it can presumably be extended, raising the rates of Medicaid and Medicare.
Dr. Douglas Kamerow (role: against): And also I would think that you'd be happy to see these kinds of-- it seems to me at least, speaking from the inside , as a conservative philosophy.
Dr. Douglas Kamerow (role: against): Hospitals or other places that are going to be left out of the networks pretty soon--
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): We've done that with Medicaid and we've done it now with Obamacare.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): It will be the same quality, the same narrow networks, because--
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): Well, it's already happening.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): If you look at the networks in Obamacare they are Medicaid networks.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): This will evolve into a Medicaid benefit.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): The changes you talk about was a temporary increase, a small increase in payments to primary care providers, that now sunsetted at the very point that we're going to push 19 more million people into Medicaid.

Jonathan Chait<against>: Political Commentator & Columnist, New York Magazine
Dr. Douglas Kamerow<against>: Family Physician & Former Assistant Surgeon General","Dr. Douglas Kamerow (role: against): Scott, you're saying-- you're describing what you would have liked, but let's be real-- let's be realistic: if the choice is we have Obamacare now, it's a law, what are the chances of any kind of scenario that you're describing taking-- taking flight, passing both houses of Congress at any time in the foreseeable future?
Dr. Douglas Kamerow (role: against): Scott, can I ask a question?
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): It’s the structure that's inherently flawed.
John Donvan (role: mod): Scott, to the point of the motion and granting all of that, are you saying that, therefore, the law cannot work, that it's doomed to collapse in on itself--
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): And then you tell insurers they can't underwrite risk, they can't use cost sharing as a tool to steer people to certain benefits or others, they can't change the benefit design, and so they're forced to do one thing which is to narrow the networks of providers that people have access to and to skinny down the drug formularies, which is exactly what we've done in Medicaid.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): And so these decisions get made in a political context, and you end up with policies that are exceedingly expensive, laden down with mandates that don't meet what consumers want.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): What's inherently wrong with this law is the way that the law tries to prescribe a uniform federal standard for what needs to be in everyone's insurance policy.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): There's nothing inherently wrong with pooling people based on what state they live in, for example, if that's the point, if this is copying Mitt Romney's plan.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): You could've given people incentives to get insured and stay insured, and it would have required that you subsidize certain people to get into the marketplace and subsidize them through transitions in life where they might otherwise not have the income and lose coverage.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): I think there were far more efficient ways to do that.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): Well, look, I-- look, in a wealthy country, I think we need to address issues of people who are priced out of the market, people who have preexisting conditions and can't find coverage.
John Donvan (role: mod): Scott Gottlieb.
John Donvan (role: mod): Would you-- in an ideal world, would Obamacare succeed or would you hate that?
John Donvan (role: mod): Is that the case?
John Donvan (role: mod): They argue that the opposition from their opponents is more ideological, that they just don't actually want the law to succeed, a question I'd actually like to put to the side arguing for the motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they also argue that the terms of the basic law, the aspirations of the law, that lots of countries do it, and that, in fact, it does work.
John Donvan (role: mod): Team arguing against the motion, Dr. Douglas Kamerow and Jonathan Chait, say, ""Yeah, the law is not perfect,"" but they're arguing that it's working in real ways already, that there are more people insured now than there were three years ago in the United States, that standards are being forced, and that-- in general, that we've come a long way.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they've described the law as a Rube Goldberg kind of apparatus and that the administration only gets away with calling it ""successful"" in any way by continuously moving the goalposts.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing for the motion, Scott Gottlieb and Megan McArdle, have argued-- in a sense, they are arguing that the law from its beginnings has always been beyond rescue, that it reduces competition, it reduces choice, it pushes people into Medicaid, a system which does not have good medical outcomes, or at least not the kind of medical outcomes that people would aspire to for it.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams arguing for and against that.
John Donvan (role: mod): The motion is ""Obamacare is now beyond rescue.""
John Donvan (role: mod): So on into round two, and round two, as I said, is where the debaters address each other directly.
John Donvan (role: mod): Try to be provocative.
John Donvan (role: mod): Try not to be ideological.
John Donvan (role: mod): And if you're going to do that, what we really request from you is not a statement or an assertion of your views, but really a question that moves these debaters along on the motion, the specific motion of whether Obamacare is beyond rescue.
John Donvan (role: mod): Be sure to include your city, state, and first name.
John Donvan (role: mod): Send us your questions on Twitter or Facebook with hashtag Obamacare so that we don't miss it.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now, I want to remind you that tonight's debate is being broadcast worldwide on our website, iq2us.org, and on FORA .tv, and if you're watching this live stream right now, we would like to hear from you.
John Donvan (role: mod): And now we go on to round two, and round two is where the debaters address one another directly and they take questions from me and from you and our live audience.
John Donvan (role: mod): Debate, where our motion is ""Obamacare is now beyond rescue.""
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you, Jonathan Chait.
Megan McArdle (role: for): I think that Jonathan is way more optimistic than I, that a death spiral isn’t possible.
Megan McArdle (role: for): Humana and other people have said it's more adverse than they expected.
Megan McArdle (role: for): But that-- neither-- leaving that point aside-- well, I mean, like he can say, ""Yes, they have,"" and we can say, ""No, they haven't,"" and you guys don't know either way, so I think this is not--
John Donvan (role: mod): Unless-- were any of you at that conference?
Jonathan Chait (role: against): There were a series of insurers quoted at the JPMorgan Conference on January 15.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb (role: for): And they've announced--
Megan McArdle (role: for): But that's not really even-- the issue is that, you know, a lot of the mechanisms they're depending on are these things called these risk corridors, which are temporary kind of reinsurance facilities to help insurers transition, and also the fact that these subsidies basically grow with the cost of the policy so that if we do start seeing adverse selection, if we do see young people not in the pools, healthy people not in the pools and so costs go up, well, then the subsidies will rise and these risk corridors will kick in.
Megan McArdle (role: for): Subsidy--
Jonathan Chait (role: against): Right, but what we're seeing right now is that they're not even going to need that kind of adjustment in the first place because they're saying the pool of people is young enough that it's meeting their expectations, that they don't need to raise premiums, whatsoever.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 9.0, 'undecided_for': 11.0, 'for_against': 2.0, 'for_for': 13.0, 'undecided_against': 16.0, 'for_undecided': 1.0, 'undecided_undecided': 4.0, 'against_undecided': 4.0, 'against_against': 40.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 9.0, 'for': 32.0, 'against': 59.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 31.0, 'for': 16.0, 'against': 53.0}}",Jonathan Chait,against,The definition of success is putting in place a law that will get at a certain point to having a dramatic expansion of coverage.

Robert Bryce (role: against): I like electricity.
Robert Bryce (role: against): I’ll gladly pay for a nicer tie or nicer--
John Donvan (role: mod): If clean energy is more expensive than conventional energy, then how does that help the economy?
Kassia Yanosek (role: for): I mean, if you look at the numbers, and I know you’ve got the numbers because you said clearly you have all the numbers.
Kassia Yanosek (role: for): You know, the IEA, for example, has done a study of the amount of subsidies that go for the fossil fuel generation globally.
Kassia Yanosek (role: for): For renewables, it was about 37 billion.
Kassia Yanosek (role: for): So I’ll just start with that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Wait, I’m not satisfied with your answer to his point.

Kassia Yanosek (role: for): This is a huge industry.

Kassia Yanosek (role: for): We're actually bringing in the opportunity to bring down costs, improve efficiency.

Robert Bryce<against>: Author, Power Hungry: The Myths of ""Green"" Energy","John Donvan (role: mod): Kassia, where are the jobs in what you're talking about?
Kassia Yanosek (role: for): They're everywhere, from investment houses, research firms, there are engineering jobs.
Kassia Yanosek (role: for): It's about getting young people into that business, into their businesses.
Kassia Yanosek (role: for): They want to be solar entrepreneurs and energy engineers.
Robert Bryce (role: against): Well, we need to change their minds.
Steven Hayward (role: against): Well, I wrote down something Kassia said earlier about “oil won't help us with our economic predicament.” Well, tell that to the people of North Dakota, which currently has a 3.5 percent unemployment rate because they're having an oil boom.
Steven Hayward (role: against): I am tempted, by the way, to ask Governor Ritter, maybe I will, how many jobs might you get in Colorado if we opened up the oil shale, 800 billion barrels worth that the Department of Energy says could be produced at about $50 a barrel.
John Donvan (role: mod): Right, right.
John Donvan (role: mod): And what did you just
Steven Hayward (role: against): We currently have a $20 billion trade deficit in green energy components, wind, and solar, and things of that kind, because, and that's why the company in Massachusetts moved to China.
Steven Hayward (role: against): They also have the raw materials that we don't have, by the way.
Steven Hayward (role: against): And so, you know, I agree to some extent that we will do a lot of innovating here, but the manufacturing is going to be done overseas, folks, for all the traditional reasons, sorry about that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Bill Ritter.
Bill Ritter (role: for): You can't make small of 2,600 jobs in a state like Colorado, it's five million people.
Bill Ritter (role: for): And, quite frankly, you have it in Pennsylvania, you have it, I think, in Ohio, you have it in Iowa.
Bill Ritter (role: for): But even as it relates to solar.
Bill Ritter (role: for): And there are solar companies that are coming here, manufacturing here, from China.
Bill Ritter (role: for): And the solar industry itself is a net exporter outside of the United States.
Robert Bryce (role: against): Well, fair enough, I mean--
Robert Bryce (role: against): I'm much more bullish on solar than I am on wind, and if you look at the data from John Byrne at the University of Delaware, he talks about the learning rate in the solar industry and solar PV, and has talked a lot about the price on solar PV coming down.
Robert Bryce (role: against): I have PV panels on the roof of my house; I wish I was able to buy them now instead of eight, nine years ago, as I did.
Robert Bryce (role: against): And then, when we talk about what's happening in the U.S.
Robert Bryce (role: against): In your own home state, Governor, Xcel is cutting their solar subsidies by half.
Robert Bryce (role: against): Because they're too expensive.
Robert Bryce (role: against): Because as I pointed out, the EIA numbers show that renewable energy from solar and wind is significantly more expensive than is conventional electricity.
Robert Bryce (role: against): They've set records, now.
Robert Bryce (role: against): The food stamp roles today are 40 percent higher than they were just three or four years ago.

Kassia Yanosek<for>: Founder of Tana Energy Capital LLC
Robert Bryce<against>: Author, Power Hungry: The Myths of ""Green"" Energy","John Donvan (role: mod): Not the noise of the wind turbine engine.
Kassia Yanosek (role: for): Governments had to be involved; these industries had to be helped along with industry.
Robert Bryce (role: against): In the Carter administration we heard that solar energy was going to be the dominant form of energy by the year 2000.
Robert Bryce (role: against): The problem here is not about subsidies, it’s not-- it’s not even about want to or belief in global warming, it’s basic physics and math.
Robert Bryce (role: against): How much power can you harness from a given area, or volume, or mass, and that’s where solar and wind just fall down.
Robert Bryce (role: against): This is basic physics.
Robert Bryce (role: against): The reason these energy sources have not been able to get off of subsidies is that they’re fighting uphill in terms of physics.
John Donvan (role: mod): No, no, I think that-- seriously, I think that’s your argument and I-- because what does it take to-- these enormous solar farms take enormous amounts of investment in land and you’re saying that it’s going to be a long, long time before it ever pays for itself, so I want to take that back to Bill Ritter because you have experience in this area.
Bill Ritter (role: for): We've got a fellow that’s got 112 turbines on his land, he’s making about $5,000 per turbine, so it’s a half a million dollars that he’s earning in income and he’s got 68 acres out of production, 68 acres, he’s still able to farm, this is-- he’s a wheat farmer, still able to farm all of that.
Bill Ritter (role: for): Think about the Mohave Desert right now where they’re building out solar and they’re doing concentrated solar power with natural gas, and this is why I don’t accept that we have this either/or.
Bill Ritter (role: for): The folks at Bright Source have 2.6 gigawatts of purchase power agreements with Southern California, and so they’re going to build out these solar towers, and they’re going to put natural gas turbines on there, and if you look at the emissions, back to thinking about it in terms of emissions, if the sun shines like it’s supposed to in the desert, and the rest of it’s natural gas, they get 24-hour power, but they reduce emissions 75 percent in that 2.6 gigawatts of power going into Southern California.
Steven Hayward (role: against): Well, this raises an interesting point about how there is no form of energy that doesn’t have some kind of environmental tradeoff except maybe for that bicycle generator the professor made for Gilligan.
Steven Hayward (role: against): At last count there are 70 wind projects around the country that are facing environmental lawsuits to stop them for various impacts.
Steven Hayward (role: against): Windmills kill about 10,000 birds a year, and they also kill a lot of bats.
Steven Hayward (role: against): Do you know how wind-- and they don’t run into the blades like birds do.
Steven Hayward (role: against): Air pressure changes by the blades explodes their lungs, so there’s no form of energy itself, the point is, is that not only have we heard that fossil fuels are clean, but so-called clean energy sources have their own environmental defects, and I’m still waiting for a coherent definition for clean for you that doesn’t conveniently feed into whatever it is you guys like.
Kassia Yanosek (role: for): Well, first of all, I’m a fan of frogs, but not of bats, so I’m not actually going to take that argument on.
Robert Bryce (role: against): How do you feel about birds?
Robert Bryce (role: against): I'm a bird person.
Kassia Yanosek (role: for): So first of all we talked about our view of what defines clean energy, it's about more efficient, cleaner energy in terms of less emissions, it's about not just talking about wind and solar here, but innovations that go beyond wind and solar.
Kassia Yanosek (role: for): It's about innovations we haven't seen yet.
Kassia Yanosek (role: for): And then, going back to the cost issue, I think we've made some very big points tonight, about how the costs are coming down the curve.
Kassia Yanosek (role: for): Because not only do we need to do that domestically, but we need to, we need an investment strategy for how we're going to be building our export economy.
Kassia Yanosek (role: for): The jobs are all over the place.
Kassia Yanosek (role: for): So, I used to work at Bechtel and BP, you know what Bechtel and BP's biggest problem is?
Kassia Yanosek (role: for): Because people don't want to be drilling engineers.

Bill Ritter (role: for): No, we say new energy-- the energy sources aren’t new.
Bill Ritter (role: for): And that’s really what-- I mean, why do we do this at all?
Bill Ritter (role: for): And if you don’t buy into human change or human-caused climate change, there are still serious environmental hazards that happen from burning hydrocarbons, right, so we care about clean.

John Donvan (role: mod): And you’re broadening it now to-- am I right?

C. Payne Lucas<against>: Writer, Speaker and Activist","George Ayittey (role: for): Well, first of all, let me address some of the comments made by C. Payne Lucas.
George Ayittey (role: for): And that is, look, take Nigeria, for example, please do not minimize the issue of corruption.
George Ayittey (role: for): It is a very serious problem that we have in Africa.
George Ayittey (role: for): Take Nigeria for example.
George Ayittey (role: for): Between 1970 and 2000, more than four hundred and fifty billion in oil revenue flowed into Nigerian company coffers.
George Ayittey (role: for): Now, according to Nuhu Ribadu, the chairman of Nigeria’s anti- corruption commission, of that amount of money, four hundred and billion was stolen by Nigeria’s military rulers.
George Ayittey (role: for): That’s a huge amount of money.
George Ayittey (role: for): Sure, certainly we can point to “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Ngozi, who has been a reformer, but what did the Obasanjo regime do to reward her?
George Ayittey (role: for): They sacked her.
George Ayittey (role: for): And now.
George Ayittey (role: for): If you look across Africa as a whole, the African Union itself says that corruption alone costs Africa one hundred and forty-eight billion dollars every year.
George Ayittey (role: for): Now, that’s more than five times the foreign aid Africa receives form all sources.
George Ayittey (role: for): So, the issue…as a matter of fact, Africa doesn’t need aid.
George Ayittey (role: for): The aid resources Africa needs can be found right there in Africa.
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): Well, I want to make clear, if you think that, uh, this corruption in Nigeria grew out of, uh, Obasanjo’s regime, I think you're wrong.
George Ayittey (role: for): I didn't say that.
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): We all, we all know Sani Abacha was the person who stole all the money in Nigeria, but the Nigerians, we got rid of him too, didn't we?
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): Every time we find corrupt politicians—
George Ayittey (role: for): Sani Abacha was worth five billion.
George Ayittey (role: for): Babangida, eight billion, you can go all the way back.
George Ayittey (role: for): Now, this didn't start, OK, recently, is start all the way back since the 1970’s.
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): Well I, I don’t disagree with you.
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): You’ve got to remember one “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” thing, in this country, this country alone, and in the world, Korean, and Tehran, and Japan, and from the Civil War all the way up to Teddy Roosevelt, corruption was rampant in this country, but these countries still grow, they still became powerful countries.
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): Corruption alone does not destroy our country, it’s the amount of corruption.
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): We’ll never eliminate it completely, but we can set in motion the conditions that will help eliminate this terrible thing.
George Ayittey (role: for): Please, let the Africans—
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): And that’s why the Africans now have played at something called knee pads too—
George Ayittey (role: for): And that sort of comparative analysis doesn’t help us.
George Ayittey (role: for): But please, don’t compare that to Africa.
Brian Lehrer (role: mod): And briefly, professor Ayittey, on the question of the role in “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” reform that the US or UN would have to play?
George Ayittey (role: for): But in the past they’ve been more of a hindrance.
George Ayittey (role: for): Number one, you need an independent and free media.
George Ayittey (role: for): Americans take their media for granted.

Brian Lehrer (role: mod): Do the United States or the United Nations have a role to play in that, in your opinion?
Brian Lehrer (role: mod): Economic reform, political reform, and intellectual reform.
Brian Lehrer (role: mod): George Ayittey, you said that Africans want three things, reform, reform, and reform.
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): And sometime aid itself is, is not related, it’s related to maintaining our relationships So those cannot be ignored.
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): We have, we have to support those places because we have strategic interests in those places.
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): And when you start to talk about aid, let’s not forget, when you talk about six hundred billion dollars of that, how much of that went to Egypt and Israel.
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): You don't ignore Nigeria.
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): So when you start to think like that and change like that, the message is getting through.
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): And on top of that, he appointed a woman by the name of Minister Ngozi, who went out “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” and looked for corruption.
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): I don’t think Nigeria was exactly a democracy under president Obarsaso Obasanjo, but I have to really give him a great deal of respect for the fact that he managed a nation of a hundred and fifty million people without any great fall down of war and decadence.
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): No, I don’t, I mean, I was surprised that we have sixteen democracies in Africa.
Brian Lehrer (role: mod): And by saying for every Mobutu you also have more great politicians, do you mean to differ greatly from George Ayittey’s estimate that of the fifty-four countries in Africa, only sixteen of them are democracies, I hope I got those numbers right…
Brian Lehrer (role: mod): C. Payne Lucas, in telling the story of the thievery of government money in the United States at the beginning, did you mean to suggest that corruption in the United States is the equivalent of the corruption in much of Africa?
George Ayittey (role: for): Let the Africans decide for themselves how bad corruption is.
George Ayittey (role: for): If you try to place corruption within Washington context, for example, suddenly there is corruption, um, in DC, in DC government, and now the latest toll is that, you know, forty-three million dollars have disappeared because of tax fraud.
George Ayittey (role: for): Let the Africans themselves determine the incidence of corruption and how important it is to them.
George Ayittey (role: for): Well, the United States, the, um, World Bank, United Nations can be helpful, um, in reforming, try to help Africa reform.
George Ayittey (role: for): And that is one of the, look, if you want to reform Africa, there’s six basic institutions that you need.
George Ayittey (role: for): That’s the first critical institution.
George Ayittey (role: for): The second institution that you need is an independent judiciary for the rule of law.
George Ayittey (role: for): Five, four, I'm sorry, you need a, um, independent, you need to have an independent central bank.
George Ayittey (role: for): Give Africans these six institutions and it would do most of the cleaning out of Africa.
Brian Lehrer (role: mod): You’ll get a, you’ll get a chance.
Brian Lehrer (role: mod): Before the debate, twenty-four percent of you voted for the motion, “Aid to Africa has Done More Harm Than Good.” Thirty-four percent of you voted against the motion, and the winner in the pre-debate vote, the winner in the pre-debate vote was undecided with forty-two “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” percent.
Brian Lehrer (role: mod): Now comes the fun part.
Brian Lehrer (role: mod): Gayle Smith, you get the first question.
Gayle Smith (role: against): OK. Um… Do you honestly, and any of you can take this, uh, your, your motion suggests that there is causality between aid and the continuation of poverty in Africa, sort of like saying there is a mortgage crisis in the United States, and therefore we should get rid of banks.
Gayle Smith (role: against): George, when you say that Africans want reform, reform, reform, and you support a motion that says aid is doing more harm than good, are you suggesting that aid is the tool that’s going to bring about reform?
William Easterly (role: for): I can take the first one, and… So, what I was talking about was aid and economic growth.","{'breakdown': None, 'post': {'undecided': 8.0, 'for': 41.0, 'against': 51.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 42.0, 'for': 24.0, 'against': 34.0}}",Brian Lehrer,mod,"Let me just do, sorry, for the sake of the radio taping, um, William Easterly?"

John McArthur (role: against): Today thirty- six out of every thousand babies die.

Gayle Smith (role: against): If we were, if the question before us is, is the US government foreign aid system broken, you would have unanimous agreement, this would be a very short debate, and we would be now drinking.
Gayle Smith (role: against): I don’t believe that it is.
Gayle Smith (role: against): I think it could do better, I think it could be more efficient, both in the eyes of American taxpayers, and importantly, as I think all of us agree, the Africans whose lives it is intended to change.
Brian Lehrer (role: mod): But are—
Brian Lehrer (role: mod): You are arguing that a broken system still does more good than harm?
Gayle Smith (role: against): “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good”
Gayle Smith (role: against): Yes, because if you look at what has been achieved, and I refer not only to the kinds of things that John talked about, but if you look at things like micro-finance, like a commodity exchange, like the provision of wireless services, those things matter in people’s lives, and I believe that that is doing good.
Gayle Smith (role: against): Absolutely.
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): Well, I’d like to ask my friend George, all these corrupt governments in Africa, first I’d like to know, is there any government in Africa that’s not corrupt?
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): Should we not just give them anything, just let them fend for themselves, and just restrict our, our whole effort to trade?
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): By the way, I am surprised that the number of villages that you, when do you work, you travel to these villages all the time on a continent that got eight hundred billion people in it, and you tell stories that after eight years of working in the peace corps and seeing peace corps volunteers in the bush talk about what they’ve been able to “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” accomplish in working with Africa is phenomenal.
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): What would you put in its place?
George Ayittey (role: for): Well um, first of all, corruption is not an issue that the US should fight, it’s Africans who have to fight that battle themselves.
George Ayittey (role: for): And uh, number one… If you want to fight corruption, there are three basic institutions that you need.
George Ayittey (role: for): That’s how you solve the problem.
George Ayittey (role: for): The second is to have an aggressive Attorney General to prosecute the corrupt.
George Ayittey (role: for): We don’t have many of these institutions in Africa, and that’s why I told you, I said that there’s six basic institutions that you need, an independent judiciary, and an independent media, free, free, an independent free media.
George Ayittey (role: for): Now, I'm not saying that, you know, corruption, that all African governments are corrupt, there are some which are honest, OK, the government of Botswana, for example, uh, it’s a “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” very transparent government which is doing very well, there are also some African countries which have made progress, uh, in stemming the tide of corruption.
George Ayittey (role: for): Okay, the World Bank was, you know, sort of, uh, been, uh, adept at this, you know, pointing out to economic success stories in Africa, ignoring the larger pictures like, you know, the Congo, Somalia, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and Nigeria, countries which have collapsed.
George Ayittey (role: for): I have indicated that the aid resources Africa desperately needs can be found in Africa, I coined the expression, “African solutions for African problems.” We’re not going to go to America, we’re not going to go to China, we’re not going to go to France, we’re not going to go to Britain and beg and beg, because this devalues our pride and dignity.

George Ayittey (role: for): And, and to the other side is this.
George Ayittey (role: for): “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” Whom exactly do you want to help in Africa.

John McArthur (role: against): It’s a great question, I'm glad you raised it, David.
John McArthur (role: against): So that’s my basic point.
John McArthur (role: against): I mean, that’s the way these story tellings work.
John McArthur (role: against): Professor Ayittey asked the question, well, what do Africans want?
John McArthur (role: against): They want very practical things.
John McArthur (role: against): So, I think it’s important that we keep in mind what the amount of resources is that’s put into this.
John McArthur (role: against): If you take out the food aid, of course, which is paying American farmers and shipping companies.
John McArthur (role: against): And just for, for context, forty-eight billion is, of course, about half of what is spend in one year in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Brian Lehrer (role: mod): You are arguing that a broken system still does more good than harm?

Gayle Smith (role: against): Yes, because if you look at what has been achieved, and I refer not only to the kinds of things that John talked about, but if you look at things like micro-finance, like a commodity exchange, like the provision of wireless services, those things matter in people’s lives, and I believe that that is doing good.

C. Payne Lucas (role: against): Should we not just give them anything, just let them fend for themselves, and just restrict our, our whole effort to trade?
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): By the way, I am surprised that the number of villages that you, when do you work, you travel to these villages all the time on a continent that got eight hundred billion people in it, and you tell stories that after eight years of working in the peace corps and seeing peace corps volunteers in the bush talk about what they’ve been able to “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” accomplish in working with Africa is phenomenal.
C. Payne Lucas (role: against): What would you put in its place?
George Ayittey (role: for): Well um, first of all, corruption is not an issue that the US should fight, it’s Africans who have to fight that battle themselves.
George Ayittey (role: for): And uh, number one… If you want to fight corruption, there are three basic institutions that you need.
George Ayittey (role: for): That’s how you solve the problem.
George Ayittey (role: for): The second is to have an aggressive Attorney General to prosecute the corrupt.
George Ayittey (role: for): We don’t have many of these institutions in Africa, and that’s why I told you, I said that there’s six basic institutions that you need, an independent judiciary, and an independent media, free, free, an independent free media.
George Ayittey (role: for): Now, I'm not saying that, you know, corruption, that all African governments are corrupt, there are some which are honest, OK, the government of Botswana, for example, uh, it’s a “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” very transparent government which is doing very well, there are also some African countries which have made progress, uh, in stemming the tide of corruption.
George Ayittey (role: for): Okay, the World Bank was, you know, sort of, uh, been, uh, adept at this, you know, pointing out to economic success stories in Africa, ignoring the larger pictures like, you know, the Congo, Somalia, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe and Nigeria, countries which have collapsed.
George Ayittey (role: for): I have indicated that the aid resources Africa desperately needs can be found in Africa, I coined the expression, “African solutions for African problems.” We’re not going to go to America, we’re not going to go to China, we’re not going to go to France, we’re not going to go to Britain and beg and beg, because this devalues our pride and dignity.

Brian Lehrer (role: mod): George Ayittey, her initial question was to you, did you want to respond briefly?
George Ayittey (role: for): I think, in the beginning paragraph, statement, she made a very interesting, uh, observation, and that is the complexity of this issue.
George Ayittey (role: for): And the fact of the matter is, look, I personally believe that Africa doesn’t need aid, and I have stated this.
George Ayittey (role: for): I mean, you pour in aid, it just leaks out.
George Ayittey (role: for): Take the amount of aid which goes into Africa every year.
George Ayittey (role: for): Compare that to the leakages.

George Ayittey (role: for): Twenty billion.
George Ayittey (role: for): OK?
George Ayittey (role: for): OK?
George Ayittey (role: for): But aid has become an industry replete with its own lobbies.
George Ayittey (role: for): They want that to continue because aid, if you, if you ask George Soros he will tell you that aid benefits the donors more than the recipients.
George Ayittey (role: for): OK?
George Ayittey (role: for): All right, this is where I say that if you want to ask the Africans, ask them what type of help they need.
George Ayittey (role: for): It has to be reformed so it benefits those that it is intended to do.
David Rieff (role: for): Yeah, I’d like, I think, I hope I'm right that it was John, that you said this, that, that you’re here to debate the present, not the past of aid.
David Rieff (role: for): And I, I mean, this is actually not a polemical question, I’d like to know why you think this time it’s not simply a, as George says, a question of interest, but that one can actually legitimately say that the present of aid is, is different from all experience past?
John McArthur (role: against): I think, uh, the point I was trying to make is that it’s probably not a good use of our time to talk about something that happened in 1975, when our premise, our question is, is aid doing more harm than good.
John McArthur (role: against): We can sit here and play armchair quarterback over 1980, 1984, any year, 1962, there’s all sorts of stories, and when we turn on the news every night we’ll hear about the latest car crash.
John McArthur (role: against): The reason I wanted to focus on the numbers is because I think the numbers tell a very different story.
John McArthur (role: against): Well, in my conversations, quite sincerely, with Africans in rural areas where, of course, you have to keep in mind just how poor rural Africa is, these are places where they're lucky to see fifty dollars of cash in a year in a family, they're living, you know, the imputed value of the economy is, uh, estimated as many two hundred dollars per capita, in the poorest countries, they want, when I talk to them, fertilizer, bed nets, clean water, functioning “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” clinics.
John McArthur (role: against): And actually, George Soros is supporting work to provide that, quite specifically.
John McArthur (role: against): The US, or all time US foreign aid, because we’ve talked a little bit about the US, is about forty- eight billion dollars to Africa all time since 1961.
John McArthur (role: against): You know, that’s about two dollars and fifty cents per African per year, it’s a very small amount of money, and I don’t know what you expect to buy from that.
John McArthur (role: against): Politics aside, to me that’s the comparison of a priority and not a priority in broad political terms.
John McArthur (role: against): I think we’re seeing that for thirty bucks per person, from all the rich countries all around the world, to Africa, we’re getting about what we pay for.
John McArthur (role: against): My question is actually, to the other side, is saying, for thirty dollars per capita per year, compared to, and I just use the past few years as a reference point, one point three million people on “Aid to Africa is Doing More Harm Than Good” anti-retrovirals, twenty percentage point increase in primary enrollment, three hundred and sixty thousand children a year’s lives saved from measles, and all the other practical programs we’ve heard of, what would be success, what would be, we’ve already heard that’s good, not harm, what would be satisfactory for thirty bucks per capita, because I don’t know how much you can buy with that money.
George Ayittey (role: for): Let me speak briefly to John, and that is, it’s true, you pointed out these success stories, but to me these success stories are really cleaning up the mess that past aid programs created.
George Ayittey (role: for): I have been to the villages myself, we are setting up malaria-free zones in villages.
George Ayittey (role: for): Everywhere that I got the villages tell me one thing, one thing that they tell me is this, look, governments have failed them.

John McArthur (role: against): Forty years ago a hundred and forty-one out of every thousand babies born in poor countries died before reaching their first birthday.
John McArthur (role: against): Routine children immunization combined with measles vaccinations in seven southern African nations starting in 1996 virtually eliminated measles in those countries by 2000.

Jeannie Suk (role: for): Many of us have made a decision whether what-- whatever kind of crime it was, whether it was worth it to us to pursue the crime or not.
Jeannie Suk (role: for): And she-- in my opinion, if I were her advisor, I would say, ""Go to the police because this is a crime, and a crime has been committed against you, the person will be arrested.""
Jeannie Suk (role: for): Well, if we were living in a reasonable world with a reasonable department of education, what would actually happen, what could happen is the possibility that short of an-- a police-like investigation and a law-like court type of tribunal, you would have some reasonable parties get involved, talk to the people, and say, you know, ""What's going on here?

Jed Rubenfeld (role: for): And the right answer is that courts should be the ones deciding.

Daisy Khan (role: against): What I’m saying is that had it been addressed at the local level it would have never become the international phenomenon that it became.
Daisy Khan (role: against): When the Philadelphia Inquirer decided to publish that same carton, they called the Muslim community and said we want to do something “Freedom of expression must include the license to offend” about this and we want to create dialogue.
Jeffrey Toobin (role: mod): Christopher, go ahead.
Christopher Hitchens (role: for): He said, “Ladies, I congratulate you on your persistence in looking them up.” I think anyone who understands that story, which I’m pleased to see everybody obviously does, will see through the sinister piffle we were treated to just now.
Christopher Hitchens (role: for): The Imams in Denmark did the following.
Christopher Hitchens (role: for): Then they added two cartoons of their own, drawn by them, one of them “Freedom of expression must include the license to offend” showing the prophet Mohammed in the shape of a pig, then they shopped those round the Muslim world until they could get kindling going under the embassies of a small democracy in the capitol cities of countries where demonstrations are normally not allowed.
Christopher Hitchens (role: for): And, David Cesarani says he doesn’t like the reminiscence of the 1930s that is inscribed in the cartoon.
Jeffrey Toobin (role: mod): David Cesarani.
David Cesarani (role: against): I think the response in the Muslim communities and in Muslim countries, and in countries of large Muslim populations was abysmal.

Sue Tierney<against>: Managing Principal at Analysis Group; Former Assistant Secretary for Policy at U.S. Dept. of Energy","Joe Nocera (role: against): I'm just interested in clarity on the positions you have staked out and it doesn't-- you don't necessarily have to be agreeing with each other, but I feel as though you're not necessarily, because Kate Hudson is saying having the petro chemical industry retake root here, particularly in new parts of the country, is not a very attractive idea.
Joe Nocera (role: against): So, is this team against fracking, against the petro chemical industry, you know, working here?
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): I think that we are not saying stop everything all at once and I don't think Kate is saying that either.
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): The really big problem is that the focus on this industry and the power and wealth of this industry is actually derailing the attempts that we have been making in the past to put a price on carbon, for example, to move ourselves to an energy-- an economy that would actually be sustainable in the future.
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): And both of our opponents have admitted that we don't.
Sue Tierney (role: against): But John, let me talk about the methane emissions and what we know about the science there.
Sue Tierney (role: against): The study has been tremendously critiqued by peers for a number of ways in which that study does not rely on what people know to be the case about emissions.
Sue Tierney (role: against): The Cornell folks have used something very, very different than that, which greatly increases the harm that methane would show relative to coal emissions.
Sue Tierney (role: against): Most of the reasonable science has said and there's a tremendous body of evidence on this, that coal-- when you combust coal at a power plant it will have twice as much emissions of greenhouse gas, including methane, than coal.
John Donvan (role: mod): Yes, please.
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): I know of only one study that actually went out into the field and measured the emissions from the gas well, and that study showed that our methane emissions are about four percent of production.
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): We just had a new EPA rule that was designed to address the emissions from the fracking system, and there was a new rule put in place that would decidedly make it better in terms of methane emissions because they would put the gas pipelines in before they actually let the gas go, and the industry successfully delayed the implementation of this green completion system for another three years.
John Donvan (role: mod): Let me bring Joe Nocera in, and Joe, let me put the question to you, because you're a journalist.
John Donvan (role: mod): Are corporations-- you made the point that you think the environmentalists are actually the ones who have squeezed information out of the corporations.
John Donvan (role: mod): In other words--
Joe Nocera (role: against): I think--
Joe Nocera (role: against): No, I think--
Joe Nocera (role: against): I think the dynamic is actually pretty different.
Joe Nocera (role: against): Fracking was basically a bunch of small companies who really developed the technology as innovators often do and then the big boys came in.
Joe Nocera (role: against): And what has happened is that the objections and the rising concern has basically caused industry, especially the big guys, to say, ""You know what?
Joe Nocera (role: against): ""And there have actually been-- you know, Shell, one of the big oil companies, they recycle most of the water that they inject in the well.
Joe Nocera (role: against): Now, part of the problem is that you can't rely on industry best practices.
Joe Nocera (role: against): And part of the problem is that the regulation is mostly done by the states, not by the federal government.
Joe Nocera (role: against): Pennsylvania, when they began, didn't regulate it very well.
Joe Nocera (role: against): They are regulating it better.
John Donvan (role: mod): Kate Hudson, Joe Nocera paints the portrait of the situation getting better in terms of both government regulation stepping up and companies fessing up, what about that?
Katherine Hudson (role: for): And I'm not particularly impressed by the example of Pennsylvania, which the communities in that state and the environment in that state suffered greatly while the state played regulatory catch-up.
Katherine Hudson (role: for): In addition to that, at the state level, across the country, there are not enough regulators to police that.","{'breakdown': None, 'post': {'undecided': 5.0, 'for': 53.0, 'against': 42.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 24.0, 'for': 38.0, 'against': 38.0}}",John Donvan,mod,"Just-- I assume that where this side draws the line though, because you've said now a couple of times you're not against fracking, you're against the pace-- the enthusiasm-- so do you see a future where fracking happens and the Marcellus Shale, the area that is now, at least in the east coast, the most controversial large area covering Pennsylvania and New York state, do you see a future where the regulation that you're asking for is so effective and the science has been so checked out that if we do go ahead and have 80 years of fracking in that area and that's okay with you?"

Deborah Goldberg (role: for): What we have argued is that the boom is the problem, that it's going much too fast, and it's outstripping both the science and the protections.
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): Well, let me be very clear either right from the start that neither of us have argued that it should stop right now.
John Donvan (role: mod): Deborah Goldberg, you’re opponents say we do know a lot about science.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right.
Joe Nocera (role: against): It can be done.
Joe Nocera (role: against): And now they're getting ready to open it up in a small way, in a safe way.
Joe Nocera (role: against): So, what's basically been happening over the last four or five years, you have cases like in New York State-- which stopped fracking until they could study it.
Joe Nocera (role: against): Certain states have passed laws that demand that the chemicals be revealed.
Joe Nocera (role: against): And that's one of a dozen examples where the issue of the chemicals-- you can go to websites now and see some of the-- most-- all of the chemicals.
Joe Nocera (role: against): Industry goes in, and the environmentalists have done a great favor to the country because they've gotten on top of the fracking issues early-- but we do know that there's methane leakage, and there's science going on right now to figure out what that leakage is and how to make the well casings better.
Joe Nocera (role: against): In any kind of boom, it is correct.
Joe Nocera (role: against): Well, first of all, I think we do know a lot.
John Donvan (role: mod): So take on the science issue and the not knowing and whether that is a signal to stop, either one of you, Joe or--
John Donvan (role: mod): And you're saying the opposite.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponents have made this statement that the boom is getting ahead of science and implicitly saying, ""Until we know a lot more, particularly on the environmental issue, the impact, we should slow down to stop.""
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to go first to the side that's arguing to-- the supporters of fracking.
John Donvan (role: mod): So we're going to go through some of that now and explore some of what they were talking about in the debate.
John Donvan (role: mod): Against coal, natural gas they say looks pretty clean, that if you look at this thing as the national security matter, as a jumpstart to an economy that needs it, that having this stuff underground and being able to get at it is an enormous gift that's dropped into our laps.
John Donvan (role: mod): They compare it to coal.
John Donvan (role: mod): Regulations can be put into place.""
John Donvan (role: mod): The other side, Sue Tierney and Joe Nocera, the defenders of fracking, the enthusiasts, are saying, ""Yes, there are risks involved, but they're manageable.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they're basically saying that the boom is getting ahead of science, that we don't know what we're getting into.
John Donvan (role: mod): Team arguing against fracking, the team that says essentially, ""No fracking way,"" Katherine Hudson and Deborah Goldberg, we have heard them say that getting the price-- the price to be paid for getting the gas out of the ground is just too high, that it is an environmental threat, that it will ruin communities, that it is more expensive than it seems, that, in fact, the harms will outweigh the benefits that were laid out by the other sides.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two members each here arguing against this motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now we go on to round two, where the debaters address each other directly and take questions from me and from you in the audience.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where the motion being argued is No Fracking Way: The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you.
Sue Tierney (role: against): No.
Sue Tierney (role: against): We should measure what is a baseline for conditions prior to drilling--
John Donvan (role: mod): If you're conceding that more work actually needs to be done, why not pause?
Sue Tierney (role: against): There are a number of different harms.
Sue Tierney (role: against): Another reason is the development of chemical jobs and industries that are coming back to the United States because natural gas is a feedstock that's supportable.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right.
John Donvan (role: mod): The good stuff is happening and to slow down the program would cause those-- those list of harms she just went through.

Joe Nocera (role: against): So, is this team against fracking, against the petro chemical industry, you know, working here?
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): I think that we are not saying stop everything all at once and I don't think Kate is saying that either.
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): The really big problem is that the focus on this industry and the power and wealth of this industry is actually derailing the attempts that we have been making in the past to put a price on carbon, for example, to move ourselves to an energy-- an economy that would actually be sustainable in the future.
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): And both of our opponents have admitted that we don't.
Sue Tierney (role: against): But John, let me talk about the methane emissions and what we know about the science there.
Sue Tierney (role: against): The study has been tremendously critiqued by peers for a number of ways in which that study does not rely on what people know to be the case about emissions.
Sue Tierney (role: against): The Cornell folks have used something very, very different than that, which greatly increases the harm that methane would show relative to coal emissions.
Sue Tierney (role: against): Most of the reasonable science has said and there's a tremendous body of evidence on this, that coal-- when you combust coal at a power plant it will have twice as much emissions of greenhouse gas, including methane, than coal.

Deborah Goldberg (role: for): We need to get off of fossil fuels a lot faster than that.
John Donvan (role: mod): Okay, Joe Nocera.
Joe Nocera (role: against): It would cause a rush to coal.
Joe Nocera (role: against): Coal is the hardest thing to compete with because it's cheap.
Joe Nocera (role: against): And I--
Sue Tierney (role: against): No, we're not.
Sue Tierney (role: against): That is helping to reduce the costs of renewable energy.
John Donvan (role: mod): Yeah, but, Sue, their argument is if we have this sustained period of really relatively less expensive energy, that, that push will fade, and come back again in 80 years when it's too late.
John Donvan (role: mod): Yeah, but that's not the answer to the question.
Sue Tierney (role: against): It is the answer to the question.
John Donvan (role: mod): Right, but will there be a drop-off in looking at alternative-- trying to develop alternative measures?
Sue Tierney (role: against): That is the case.
John Donvan (role: mod): Joe Nocera’s opening remarks talked about a part of this.

Sue Tierney<against>: Managing Principal at Analysis Group; Former Assistant Secretary for Policy at U.S. Dept. of Energy","John Donvan (role: mod): Is Deborah right?
John Donvan (role: mod): So, what-- what does that mean, then?
Sue Tierney (role: against): Deborah pointed out--
Sue Tierney (role: against): We should know a whole lot more.
Sue Tierney (role: against): We don't know everything.
Sue Tierney (role: against): And we actually-- there's a great deal that we know about that.
Sue Tierney (role: against): One of the things that the debate about what we know about the science focuses on is the question of how much methane emissions are leaking from the entire life cycle, from the production well all the way to the consumers' burner tip.
Sue Tierney (role: against): I'd like to weigh in on this one.
Sue Tierney (role: against): John, yeah.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right, Susan.
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): You know, we are learning something because of public pressure, but there's a long way to go.
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): And follow-up afterwards?
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): And additional studies during operation?
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): We don't ask for that.” So, how are you going to do serious science if you don't have a baseline test of the conditions?
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): And what they told me was, “We don't have any.
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): So, for example, I just submitted a Freedom of Information request to New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, asking them for the results of water quality studies that they had done in connection with oil and gas development in the state.
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): And the reason that we don't know that is that the industry has done everything in its power to keep us from getting the data that we need in order to really do the study.
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): But the fact of the matter is, there's a great deal that we don't know.
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): Well, we learned, we have learned more recently.
John Donvan (role: mod): But to Joe Nocera's point, where he says, actually, we-- refuting you and saying that we actually do know a good amount now, can you take that on?
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): So, we think that what-- for example, what New York has done, makes a great deal of sense, is stop for a while, when it's not necessary, we have a glut coming from other places-- and take a look at what the impacts are-- and figure out what needs to be done.
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): What we have argued is that the boom is the problem, that it's going much too fast, and it's outstripping both the science and the protections.
Deborah Goldberg (role: for): Well, let me be very clear either right from the start that neither of us have argued that it should stop right now.
John Donvan (role: mod): Deborah Goldberg, you’re opponents say we do know a lot about science.
John Donvan (role: mod): All right.
Joe Nocera (role: against): It can be done.
Joe Nocera (role: against): And now they're getting ready to open it up in a small way, in a safe way.
Joe Nocera (role: against): So, what's basically been happening over the last four or five years, you have cases like in New York State-- which stopped fracking until they could study it.
Joe Nocera (role: against): Certain states have passed laws that demand that the chemicals be revealed.
Joe Nocera (role: against): And that's one of a dozen examples where the issue of the chemicals-- you can go to websites now and see some of the-- most-- all of the chemicals.
Joe Nocera (role: against): Industry goes in, and the environmentalists have done a great favor to the country because they've gotten on top of the fracking issues early-- but we do know that there's methane leakage, and there's science going on right now to figure out what that leakage is and how to make the well casings better.
Joe Nocera (role: against): In any kind of boom, it is correct.
Joe Nocera (role: against): Well, first of all, I think we do know a lot.
John Donvan (role: mod): So take on the science issue and the not knowing and whether that is a signal to stop, either one of you, Joe or--
John Donvan (role: mod): And you're saying the opposite.
John Donvan (role: mod): Your opponents have made this statement that the boom is getting ahead of science and implicitly saying, ""Until we know a lot more, particularly on the environmental issue, the impact, we should slow down to stop.""
John Donvan (role: mod): And I want to go first to the side that's arguing to-- the supporters of fracking.
John Donvan (role: mod): So we're going to go through some of that now and explore some of what they were talking about in the debate.
John Donvan (role: mod): Against coal, natural gas they say looks pretty clean, that if you look at this thing as the national security matter, as a jumpstart to an economy that needs it, that having this stuff underground and being able to get at it is an enormous gift that's dropped into our laps.
John Donvan (role: mod): They compare it to coal.
John Donvan (role: mod): Regulations can be put into place.""
John Donvan (role: mod): The other side, Sue Tierney and Joe Nocera, the defenders of fracking, the enthusiasts, are saying, ""Yes, there are risks involved, but they're manageable.
John Donvan (role: mod): And they're basically saying that the boom is getting ahead of science, that we don't know what we're getting into.
John Donvan (role: mod): Team arguing against fracking, the team that says essentially, ""No fracking way,"" Katherine Hudson and Deborah Goldberg, we have heard them say that getting the price-- the price to be paid for getting the gas out of the ground is just too high, that it is an environmental threat, that it will ruin communities, that it is more expensive than it seems, that, in fact, the harms will outweigh the benefits that were laid out by the other sides.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have two teams of two members each here arguing against this motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): Now we go on to round two, where the debaters address each other directly and take questions from me and from you in the audience.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where the motion being argued is No Fracking Way: The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good.
John Donvan (role: mod): Thank you.

Paul Nemitz (role: for): The notion here tonight is not the US should adopt the EU ""right to be forgotten"" as ruled by the European Court of Justice exactly.
Paul Nemitz (role: for): So, I think the understanding where we are coming from is different, and I would like to, like Jonathan, distinguish this notion from other things you might be thinking about.
Paul Nemitz (role: for): Dictators don't want anybody to have privacy.
Paul Nemitz (role: for): And that is the history of this right you have to think about.
Paul Nemitz (role: for): There was a block reporter in every block of housing.
Paul Nemitz (role: for): They wanted to know everything about you.
Paul Nemitz (role: for): History has taught Europeans, whether fascistic dictators or communist dictators they don't want any privacy.
Paul Nemitz (role: for): I would see it exactly the other way around.
Paul Nemitz (role: for): And our moral standing would be undermined if we allow this right to be exercised in democratic societies.
Paul Nemitz (role: for): This would be a tool for dictators.
Paul Nemitz (role: for): I heard this very clearly.
John Donvan (role: mod): Paul Nemitz.
John Donvan (role: mod): How do you respond to that?
John Donvan (role: mod): But that amounts to censorship.
John Donvan (role: mod): The dirty word that your opponents have raised repeatedly is ""censorship,"" that the kind of right that we're talking about, where an individual can go to Google and say, ""When my name comes up, I don't want this link to show up or this link to show up or this link to show up.""
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go to the team that's arguing in support of this motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): And more importantly, they say the whole thing smacks of censorship that will lead to a system where nobody knows what's being taken out, and stuff taken out may never once again return to the public realm.
John Donvan (role: mod): This issue of privacy, but they say the solution, the ""right to be forgotten,"" is a terrible solution because it conflicts, number one, with the right to remember, which they argue is an important and valid right.
John Donvan (role: mod): The team arguing against the motion, Andrew McLaughlin and Jonathan Zittrain, they concede that this really is a problem.
John Donvan (role: mod): Think of it in terms of informational self-determination.
John Donvan (role: mod): They say put this in terms of a right to delete.
John Donvan (role: mod): Paul Nemitz and Eric Posner have argued that technological change means that the balance that once existed between privacy and free speech is now all wrong, and it needs to be restored in a world where the worst moment in a person's otherwise well-lived life can be the thing that stalks them through forever through search results on Google.
John Donvan (role: mod): We have heard one team arguing for this motion.
John Donvan (role: mod): Our motion is, the US should adopt the ""right to be forgotten"" online.
John Donvan (role: mod): Round two is where the debaters address one another in turn and take questions from me and from you in our live audience here at the Kaufman Center in New York City.
John Donvan (role: mod): On to round two.
John Donvan (role: mod): And it will be the team whose numbers have moved the most who will be declared our winner.
John Donvan (role: mod): Again, we're going to have you vote a second time after you have heard all of the arguments.
John Donvan (role: mod): Keep in mind, please, how you voted at the top of the evening.
John Donvan (role: mod): And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared US debate, where our motion is the US should adopt the ""right to be forgotten"" online.

Eric Posner (role: for): Relevance is a term that comes up over and again.
Eric Posner (role: for): Now, the rules as they're stated are vague, but when you actually read the cases it becomes pretty clear what's going on.
Eric Posner (role: for): Famous people don't win.

Jonathan Zittrain (role: against): That's what happens when cases are heard by courts.
Jonathan Zittrain (role: against): Eric, I want to ask you directly, in this right to be forgotten when you have a private company making the decision at the insistence of the government it must keep its secret, the cases we hear about are happenstance, how does that evolution take place?
John Donvan (role: mod): Paul Nemitz.
Paul Nemitz (role: for): Because before the Google case, as I explained to you, we had the right to deletion and, for example, you know, newspapers they have to make on a daily basis a decision do we publish something or not, and if they get a request, for example, to correct or to take down from a website some information, they have to make this decision.
Paul Nemitz (role: for): But if you go to European court of human rights, for example, the Von Hannover case, very clear criteria.
Paul Nemitz (role: for): A) whenever the information is of relevant, of public interest in a democracy as a contribution to public debate, it cannot be taken down.
Paul Nemitz (role: for): So, I would say Eric has said it right.
John Donvan (role: mod): Andrew--
John Donvan (role: mod): Well, let me--
Paul Nemitz (role: for): Newspapers have to make these decisions--
John Donvan (role: mod): I want to go to Andrew McLaughlin to respond to the point that Paul was just making.
John Donvan (role: mod): What about that?
Andrew McLaughlin (role: against): I have no idea whether the majority of cases are being used by famous people or not famous people.
Andrew McLaughlin (role: against): My point is that this right is, in my judgment, a typical kind of like EU elite construction dressed up as a privacy right, but in fact designed to allow the well-connected, the politicians, the business people to suppress embarrassing facts about their past.
Andrew McLaughlin (role: against): The record is-- well, it's part of my sort of cynical experience with the institutions of EU, to be quite honest with you.
Andrew McLaughlin (role: against): Let me say-- but let me say.
Andrew McLaughlin (role: against): It's just the way that it takes form over there.
Andrew McLaughlin (role: against): That was my search, and I produced a bunch of articles, the Guardian, the Daily Mail, that are absolutely contrary to Paul's assurances that this is somehow only being used in cases which are not in the public interest.
Andrew McLaughlin (role: against): So, for example, there is a story-- I'm just taking one at random here, where a Scottish premier league referee named “Dougie” McDonald-- there was an article from 2010 about how he was found to have lied about a penalty call that he made in a Celtics versus Dundee United match, the backlash to which prompted his resignation.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 5.0, 'undecided_for': 9.0, 'for_against': 8.0, 'for_for': 21.0, 'undecided_against': 26.0, 'for_undecided': 5.0, 'undecided_undecided': 3.0, 'against_undecided': 1.0, 'against_against': 22.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 9.0, 'for': 35.0, 'against': 56.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 38.0, 'for': 36.0, 'against': 26.0}}",Jonathan Zittrain,against,"Well, there goes this debate."

Minxin Pei (role: against): Modern capitalist societies are a lot riskier than traditional agrarian societies because in a modern capitalist society, once you lose your job, you really have no source of income.
Minxin Pei (role: against): Let me just say something about China.
Minxin Pei (role: against): The same thing is true of China, because the Chinese national debt is actually higher than the American debt.

Minxin Pei (role: against): I think the best measure of whether a country is capitalist is to look at the contribution to GDP from state-owned companies.
Minxin Pei (role: against): In China state- owned companies contribute 40 percent to GDP.
Minxin Pei (role: against): Now, probably little less than 1 percent.
Peter Schiff (role: for): Well, you can't compare though government debt to corporate debt.

Orville Schell (role: for): And I think what we have to reckon with is the chances of each country finding a new state of equipoise, the United States included.
Orville Schell (role: for): I think if this country cannot grasp reason again, it doesn’t matter how good or bad China will be, China may have an unfair advantage.
Orville Schell (role: for): And we are not playing it.
John Donvan (role: mod): Minxin Pei, what about that?
Minxin Pei (role: against): Well, in China, they plan a lot, except they do nothing about the plans they draw up.
Minxin Pei (role: against): And then, five years later, and you do some kind of plan accounting and you see what has been accomplished-- very little, because if they have actually followed through on their promises, China today would indeed be doing capitalism a lot better than the U.S.
Peter Schiff (role: for): Well, you know--
Peter Schiff (role: for): Not that particular point, but there’s some other points that he made earlier that I’d--
John Donvan (role: mod): Tell us what the point was and go for it.
Peter Schiff (role: for): Well, I would say that we get a lot more liability.
Peter Schiff (role: for): And what the government is giving the American people is debt.
Peter Schiff (role: for): I think it’s much better that the Chinese are free to keep their income and plan for their retirement.
Minxin Pei (role: against): I don’t think so, because capitalism produces efficiency, but it also has a lot of risks.
Minxin Pei (role: against): You cannot grow your own potatoes.

Ian Bremmer (role: against): Look, the United States has so many strong intrinsic advantages in terms of not just the matter of where the dollar sits but also, I mean, 30 percent of the world’s calories comes from the United States.
Ian Bremmer (role: against): People are increasingly fighting over food.
Ian Bremmer (role: against): That’s a real problem for China.
Ian Bremmer (role: against): The environment in China is absolutely falling apart.
Ian Bremmer (role: against): If you look at environment-adjusted GDP, it’s so much worse than the growth you see presently.
Ian Bremmer (role: against): We already heard from Minxin about just how much more profitable American multinationals are than Chinese SOEs, and yet that China is moving more in the direction towards SOEs, not towards private sectors, especially since 2008.
Ian Bremmer (role: against): All of these things are problematic, and the ability of the Chinese to suddenly make a decision to go away from the dollar, you have to go into something.

John Donvan (role: mod): And Orville Schell, you, in making that point before, you went on to say that you think that the model of planning, which we used to think was quaint and slightly ridiculous, maybe we should be looking at in a new light now.
John Donvan (role: mod): Is a little planning a good thing after all, or a lot of planning?

Glenn Hubbard (role: for): First of all, there's been some discussion of Bowles-Simpson, but I think it's important for everyone to understand the marginal tax-- the top marginal rate in the Bowles-Simpson compromise plan is 28 percent.
Glenn Hubbard (role: for): If we have a healthy tax system, the growth that that engenders will, in fact, raise revenue, yes, but it's not by raising tax rates.
Glenn Hubbard (role: for): If you look across industrial countries, the U.S. actually has, by far, the most progressive tax system.
Glenn Hubbard (role: for): The third point I want to mention, if you add up all the tax increases on the rich that are currently being discussed in Washington, it's about 1 percent of GDP.
Glenn Hubbard (role: for): They would tell you that the long-term problem in Social Security and Medicare alone is on the order of 10 percentage points of GDP.

Arthur Laffer (role: for): We've got to achieve the income distribution we want and the prosperity-- through growth.
John Donvan (role: mod): And he's basically saying, ""Should rates be lowered-- should rates be raised on income that comes from buying and selling stuff versus lowered on people who actually make stuff for a living?""
Arthur Laffer (role: for): We made it the same as every other.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): I think you should get it so that all forms of income are the same.

Robert Reich (role: against): In fact, the rich would do better with a smaller share of a rapidly growing economy than a large share of an economy that's dead in the water.
Robert Reich (role: against): Because it's dead in the water because the distribution of income is so crazy.
Robert Reich (role: against): And that's why-- and that is directly relevant to the point that Arthur and Glenn are making, or are attempting to make-- and are not making actually very well--
Arthur Laffer (role: for): There he was almost nice, but seriously, I mean, the point of it here is ""Let's take the '20s that you're talking about.""
Arthur Laffer (role: for): We had that growth.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): There's nothing wrong with the rich being rich.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): The dream has always been to make the poor rich, and during the '20s, when we had the Roaring '20s, no other country did the tax codes we did.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): That is the key here.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): But I'll tell you what happened in the 1920s-- and they paid a lot more in taxes.
Robert Reich (role: against): What happened?
Robert Reich (role: against): And people at the top gambled, and they gambled recklessly.
John Donvan (role: mod): Again, a great applause line, but I'm not seeing how this is justifying taxing the rich.
Glenn Hubbard (role: for): Mark very helpfully, earlier, referred to a lot of structural problems facing the country.
Glenn Hubbard (role: for): You referred to globalization, there are skill gaps among low income people, I'm not connecting the dots, from your tax policy to dealing with the problem that actually should concern America.
Mark Zandi (role: against): I think it's important that we address the distribution of income and wealth, because if we don't, we're going to have the situation that Arthur joked about but is very serious.
Mark Zandi (role: against): Art joked about buying a senator, buying a congressman.
Mark Zandi (role: against): I mean, I think that's a very serious issue.
Mark Zandi (role: against): And we can't allow that to happen.
Mark Zandi (role: against): This is the reason why we have to be very, very conscious of this.
Mark Zandi (role: against): We need the revenue to go to the government sufficient to educate the population and bring the skill attainment of those workers that are getting creamed by China up, so that they can compete in a global economy.
Mark Zandi (role: against): Now, we all know revenue is very low, 17 percent of GDP.
Mark Zandi (role: against): It's very, very low.
Mark Zandi (role: against): I'm all for getting government spending down.
John Donvan (role: mod): Mark, can I bring--
Mark Zandi (role: against): I have to make one other point.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 5.0, 'undecided_for': 7.0, 'for_against': 7.0, 'for_for': 19.0, 'undecided_against': 14.0, 'for_undecided': 2.0, 'undecided_undecided': 4.0, 'against_undecided': 2.0, 'against_against': 42.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 7.0, 'for': 30.0, 'against': 63.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 23.0, 'for': 28.0, 'against': 49.0}}",Mark Zandi,against,Because this goes right to Arthur's--

Mark Zandi<against>: Chief Economist of Moody's Analytics","Arthur Laffer (role: for): I think you just agreed with us.
John Donvan (role: mod): Yes, Mark Zandi?
Mark Zandi (role: against): First, this is my view.
Mark Zandi (role: against): We have to.
Mark Zandi (role: against): So, I'm with you on that.
Mark Zandi (role: against): This has got to be a shared burden in terms of spending and tax.
Mark Zandi (role: against): The second thing I say is that if we can raise tax revenue by lowering the deductions and credits in the tax code-- and there're some very creative ways of doing it.
Mark Zandi (role: against): Both Governor Romney and President Obama have put proposals that are not dissimilar in this regard in terms of capping the amount of deductions and credits that an individual can take, and that would burden-- in theory, would land on higher-income households.
Mark Zandi (role: against): But I think it's also important that we do this in a way that we're clear-eyed, because-- in a political sense, a political economy sense-- because we know it's going to be really hard to scale back those deductions and credits in the tax code.
Mark Zandi (role: against): So, we know that.
John Donvan (role: mod): As a temporary thing, not as a long-term principle of the way--
Mark Zandi (role: against): You can't--
Glenn Hubbard (role: for): You can't do that either in the short-term or the long-term.
Glenn Hubbard (role: for): The current budget has spending full three percentage points higher than traditional levels in the country.
Glenn Hubbard (role: for): In the long term, as I've said, just Social Security and Medicare alone are 10 times the cost, even of the most optimistic tax increases.
Glenn Hubbard (role: for): And, to the extent that they are, they would have to follow the European model, which is to raise them on everyone, a consumption tax.
Robert Reich (role: against): We're getting tangled in a semantic dispute, and I want to be very, very clear about what we are actually arguing.
Robert Reich (role: against): Almost everybody up here agrees, I think, that we've got to raise some revenues.
Robert Reich (role: against): There are two ways of doing it.
Robert Reich (role: against): Now, the question really is when you do one or both of those, are you going to have the rich paying more, or is the middle class going to have to pay more, or the poor going to have to pay more?
John Donvan (role: mod): All right.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): Let's just talk about it.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): I mean-- and there's nothing wrong with the rich paying more in taxes if-- with the prosperity, which is exactly what happened, what I showed in the numbers there.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): If you look at the Kennedy period, the rich paid a lot more as a share of GDP by lowering rates dramatically.
Arthur Laffer (role: for): That is the dream, and that's where we go.

Mark Zandi (role: against): Let me advance the ball just a little bit, and that is-- it's very important to look at effective tax rates, so that's how much I pay in tax relative to the income I earn, not the marginal rates, it's the effective tax rates.","{'breakdown': {'against_for': 5.0, 'undecided_for': 7.0, 'for_against': 7.0, 'for_for': 19.0, 'undecided_against': 14.0, 'for_undecided': 2.0, 'undecided_undecided': 4.0, 'against_undecided': 2.0, 'against_against': 42.0}, 'post': {'undecided': 7.0, 'for': 30.0, 'against': 63.0}, 'pre': {'undecided': 23.0, 'for': 28.0, 'against': 49.0}}",Mark Zandi,against,"And, in fact, interesting statistic, for the top 1 percent of earners, the decline in the effective tax rate, 1979 to 2010, has declined by more than any other income group, the effective tax rate."
